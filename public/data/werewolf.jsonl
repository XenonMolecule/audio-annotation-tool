[SPEAKER_03] Robert Wake Up [SPEAKER_03] You may exchange your heart with another player's heart and then view your new card. [SPEAKER_03] Robert, close your eyes. [SPEAKER_03] Trouble maker, wake up. You may exchange cards between two other players. [SPEAKER_03] Trouble maker, close your eyes. Insomniac, wake up and look at your card. [SPEAKER_03] In Sambhya, close your eyes. Everyone, keep your eyes closed and reach out and move your car around slightly. [SPEAKER_01] Man, did anyone else feel like they were falling when their eyes were closed? No, wait. God. [SPEAKER_02] No, but that does happen to me once here. [SPEAKER_01] Do we have a fear of why he says like one night? Few of us. Just Easter eggs. All right, so these little tokens we can use to represent people. So Paul saying he was a big. I was a big. [SPEAKER_02] Just [SPEAKER_02] I was a villager, I have no information. [SPEAKER_00] Obviously and ask ya [SPEAKER_03] hours lot's so fella sure, ducking [SPEAKER_00] Do you like it here? Move quite a bit during the night. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, well that's because it was dancing, but uh... [SPEAKER_03] We will start, if we can voice those people out. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I tried to move the whole time. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, yeah, I'm just on I'm there. [SPEAKER_01] Radar. [SPEAKER_01] So James and I, or did you wake, or did you see that James and I say, Oh, I can tell you. [SPEAKER_02] Oh yeah. Mitch, if you wanna talk now you go ahead. Last I saw. [SPEAKER_01] That was the situation. So you were the Robert, and I was, when you stole from him, and then, and I was disappointed, and I was like, fuck, witness protection. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] Alright, well I can confirm James's story that he was the robber. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Alright, I woke up as myself. Born. Born, is this really? [SPEAKER_00] Is this real life? Because this is a fuzzy wasy. Which is a fuzzy wasy? Here's what can happen. I could be a werewolf, because I have no alibi. He also could be. Why could be? Who else could be? [SPEAKER_01] lou? [SPEAKER_01] James and I could both be werewolves. [SPEAKER_00] Technically I could also be. Basically, is there anyone who has been living with him? No, no, no. I mean, it was definitely a villager. Oh yeah, you're... [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, basically. [SPEAKER_02] Who is the only one who's definitely villager? Oh, yeah, you I can I know Paul's telling the truth Because I stole his card and I believe Jesus [SPEAKER_01] Okay. [SPEAKER_01] And I believe James' story, because... [SPEAKER_01] You saw a Paul's card? I saw your card. I should have given it. That's a villager. No, I was a seer. I saw yours the robber. Yeah. You gotcha. [SPEAKER_02] I shouldn't have guessed it. [SPEAKER_03] Malenger [SPEAKER_00] I know I was a seer of the wooden metal. I saw you as the robber. Oh. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Music [SPEAKER_00] We've got a pickle. I know someone else won. [SPEAKER_01] I know someone else won. [SPEAKER_01] I think it was David or whatever, I'm not sure his name was time. [SPEAKER_02] I have some suspicions about Mitchell because he gave away that he was the Insomniac so fast. I think he made it to the idea that he had to have that. [SPEAKER_01] I feel like maybe Orki is saying that because he was the insomniac and he woke up the insomniac so he's essentially a villager [SPEAKER_01] Because if it's on the actor, it doesn't change. This basically, nothing. They know nothing. They just don't bring themselves. Right. [SPEAKER_03] Presidents on the Acre, it doesn't change. [SPEAKER_00] It doesn't change. [SPEAKER_02] this. [SPEAKER_02] And just not bring themselves right but I'm saying if he was a werewolf and sawdain sound in the middle that would be a really It would be a safe fence exactly where so this [SPEAKER_01] You would be safe for that thing to stack a well-begin. [SPEAKER_01] what we're saying right now. No troublemakers shifted us out. [SPEAKER_02] Right that's what we're saying right now. I feel like if somebody was the troll maker they would have Trying to get some chaos on it or if anything else they would have yeah [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I'll try to get some chaos right here. [SPEAKER_01] I'm gonna hedge my bets on Mitch line. I think, yeah, I kinda think Mitch is like. I don't think Mitch is like. I am. [SPEAKER_02] I think, yeah, I kind of think that just like- I don't think much about- I don't- [SPEAKER_02] This makes me think... [SPEAKER_00] No, because what do you mean just in our both where? [SPEAKER_01] It's also possibility, but it's not. [SPEAKER_02] There's no way that they're both wearables because if they're both lie about what they were Not knowing that none of us were that Would have been too risky [SPEAKER_01] Oh [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] Because Mitch copped to being the insomniac before. Does the C or C before the... Robert Ross? [SPEAKER_01] Does this see her? [SPEAKER_01] Yes, yes. [SPEAKER_01] It goes, it can catch you in a wide. It goes, werewolf, sear, robber, troublemaker, and saunha. There's the numbers on it. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Fair enough. [SPEAKER_03] There's the numbers on it. [SPEAKER_01] I also don't think Laura's the wherewolf because I don't think in her first game she would go for a village or lie as a wherewolf. [SPEAKER_01] That's a bit of meta working, but... I'd be so pissed about the world, because I would hate learn. That's time so much. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I think what was... [SPEAKER_00] What is happening? There's ways to get points. [SPEAKER_01] Did you pronounce his name as M Bessica? That's Bessica. What did Messica? [SPEAKER_02] What did my car call you or something today? [SPEAKER_02] I'm doing my bossic Bossic sounds like some robots [SPEAKER_01] I ?! Howty ! [SPEAKER_01] Hey, you're saying it to Paul, sorry. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] I'm a god Sort of you better turn me left [SPEAKER_01] 2 minutes left. My voice from it. [SPEAKER_02] Why aren't you the werewolf? And because I'm the insult- [SPEAKER_00] Because I didn't saw a react I'm not gonna convince you that's gonna be my my attempt here if I was a werewolf I'd get defensive [SPEAKER_02] SUNMIRAC Radiga Mr. NAJIM Wu [SPEAKER_01] Okay. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] No. [SPEAKER_02] Fuck he's not you were like here. Let me move all of the parts of my face really suddenly [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Don't think it's a werewolf, I do. [SPEAKER_01] Well then why don't we vote left because then James gets a vote for Mitchell? [SPEAKER_02] You can do that, but Paul knows he's a werewolf too, so only 30 cents left. For you suspicious of Mitchell. Oh, I know, I know, I know Paul. [SPEAKER_03] Only 30 satisfaction less. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] No, I think you would I think you'd be getting defensive at this point. No, I don't think so. I think you would be I don't think it would be [SPEAKER_01] I'm not killing Mitchell because you guys would know what I'm gonna put it on my wife. [SPEAKER_02] I think you guys are all of the time against a sweet story. I'm voting for Mitchell. I don't know what to say. [SPEAKER_00] I think it's more important than you out here. [SPEAKER_00] I don't know what to say. I was in Samyak. Welcome to the Samyak. Get in a lot of camp. I can't. [SPEAKER_01] Get a lot of hair to murder a new person. I'm gonna have to go to the scene. Tell you who's up there. Yeah, just an important thing. Oh, as soon as he... [SPEAKER_03] I have a lot of people to say. Tell you who's up there. Just at every point here. [SPEAKER_02] Oh!"}

[SPEAKER_01] peanut butterbeam, Laura, peanut butterbeam says your hair is amazing. [SPEAKER_00] In about a minute we have Laura's... [SPEAKER_00] I'm trying to fix it. [SPEAKER_01] Oh I was looking about the right side just tried to take that compliment All right, I was a little conceited. I was a troublemaker and I did [SPEAKER_00] It is like, dude, we just... Alright. [SPEAKER_01] Peace be yo. [SPEAKER_01] I know I'm holding that information until we start finding something. Fancy, I was searing, I know there's a werewolf out there. Oh shit. [SPEAKER_00] That's it. I will see you. [SPEAKER_01] Fascinating, but now it should be worried about who he switched. I'm not going to hear everybody's, I'm not going to say anything. [SPEAKER_00] But now we're... [SPEAKER_00] \u0645\u0627 \u0631\u0648\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0627iri \u0644\u0627 \u0645\u0634\u0631\u0641 [SPEAKER_00] It wasn't me, I was one of these three. [SPEAKER_01] So you're pointing to a villager robber or his sound yet. [SPEAKER_00] and the Villager, Robert, Insomniac. [SPEAKER_00] are my possibilities. Well, I started out with the film. [SPEAKER_01] started as a villager. [SPEAKER_00] sounds like a world. [SPEAKER_01] Alright James, so that leaves you with two wearables. And you're off to work. Thanks. That's what I'm gonna be for you. This one. How is this? This. [SPEAKER_00] Were you thinking this one? Or were you this one? [SPEAKER_01] And you saw that? Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] So who'd you switch? I switched you with somebody. Whoa! So you would know the answer. [SPEAKER_01] Who did you see, Nijou? I saw two in the middle and they were not werewolves. Okay, that makes sense. Well, did you see? [SPEAKER_00] I saw it two in the middle. [SPEAKER_01] That one? You do not see trouble maker, right? [SPEAKER_00] Do not see trouble maker. [SPEAKER_01] No, I didn't put. [SPEAKER_00] I guess you are on a very longyo theory. [SPEAKER_01] So all right Paul can we get some uh can you remove um okay I know which one is those three Paul is because I two of those three I saw him nice but why don't you just out of yeah let's see what he says that's you can't just do that to a guy like Paul [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] I know which one is those three. [SPEAKER_00] Nice morning just [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I'll see what he says. [SPEAKER_00] Well so, make sure you can confirm I was like, good guy. [SPEAKER_00] You already can put it over here. Ah, because it builds. [SPEAKER_01] What you can put some over here? Yeah, because the bills are sporing. So you're going to be worried. You've already confirmed that I- [SPEAKER_00] You've already confirmed that I'm a good guy. Uh, because you know which one I am. [SPEAKER_01] be good. [SPEAKER_01] Well, I know which to you. [SPEAKER_00] But yeah, so of these three you basically Accidentally confirmed that I am one of the three sure so I was a good guy So did you switch me with the James Lord? Did you did you pick village? [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, that's all. [SPEAKER_01] I am one of the three. Sure, so I was a good guy. [SPEAKER_01] just so you didn't have to play the game. You could just be quiet. I don't think Laura's the wherewolf now. I thought you were the wherewolf. You know that you were the wherewolf. [SPEAKER_00] Fighting Grrb. [SPEAKER_01] Maybe there's my ears to gain a villager. I just need, I want to know if what you are because that's... [SPEAKER_00] My \u0434\u0435\u0441\u044f Something bat. [SPEAKER_01] I don't want to give bad news to you until I consider your face. [SPEAKER_00] Here's a thing Laura if I'm lying if I'm not the insomnia and she was the insomnia And you switched her you're saying you're trying to make a view she could have woken up as James's where will and this villager Could be one of the three of mine or actually the ones in here [SPEAKER_01] Ben de \u015fuanda... ... 2002'den... [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. One of them was one of them, a villager. [SPEAKER_00] We tell us that. [SPEAKER_01] No. Give us one of them. No, one of them was not a villager. Give us one of them. So I saw, oh, so that gave us a lot of info of what I saw. Yeah. If you guys can narrow it down, what I saw was the rubber in and saw him, yeah. Yeah. It was these two you saw. So that's what. [SPEAKER_00] Give us one of them. [SPEAKER_00] If you guys can hear what that was, the rubber and the saw me out. [SPEAKER_00] We're saying right. We're asking a question. So for me to ask, you guys are both villagers? [SPEAKER_01] I think Laura's the way I wolf now. Okay, what I switched James and me in Paul. [SPEAKER_01] So you were the where we'll? [SPEAKER_00] Unless, gee, unless, Justin is actually... So you were the werewolf? Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] So you were the werewolf? Yeah. Alright, I switched you two. No. No, you and Paul. I didn't switch James, I didn't touch James. [SPEAKER_00] I didn't do it. [SPEAKER_00] You were just confirming and you were doing my strategy. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, well here's a fun story. I know Paul's dirty fucking liar because I was a villager [SPEAKER_00] So Should we vote for Mitch? Yeah, I agree. Let's get let's we've been left Which is worse having in our village Which are all over or Honestly, I'm good to kill James if you guys are I'm a villager No, no one believes that no Paul's a fucking line started the game with I was [SPEAKER_01] Okay, I'll make it. Okay, but should we vote for match? Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Mitch or Oliver or Mitch? Like, honestly. I'm good to kill James if you guys are. I'm good to kill James. [SPEAKER_01] Because I want to see what other people would fuck up. Oh, you're such a thing. If Paul is a werewolf, he's about to lose if we vote for you. And he's going to vote for you. Yeah, I'm going to vote for you. Why? Why? Because Mitch is currently the werewolf. If that's the case. [SPEAKER_00] Who wants one? [SPEAKER_00] Oh, [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] I was like, what? No, I would be if I was wearable, but yeah, because Mitchell would be, you know. [SPEAKER_01] Why am I in mids? Because it's nice. I'll get in mids again. No, I think we kill James. [SPEAKER_00] Have a look up this horse-pin the Aristotle matches. Thank you so much. [SPEAKER_00] Subscribe [SPEAKER_00] Oh, that was it. So he told us he was the werewolf for the beginning, right? Because I said I did. And then when Justin said no, he didn't actually switch James and we end somebody. It was actually me and Mitch. He said he had made if he was a werewolf. So he didn't actually move. So he's still a werewolf. No, no, I said. I said, I was never a werewolf. I was a village. [SPEAKER_01] So keep told us he was... [SPEAKER_01] Because I said I said [SPEAKER_01] somebody in [SPEAKER_01] He said he admitted he was a wearable. [SPEAKER_01] No, no, I was never aware of how the village in Palsalai are. I think we killed James. And if it was time, I would say individuals, because he got switched to three. [SPEAKER_00] If I was trying, I would say individuals, because he got switched with three."}

You've won West Village, or this is a war wall. [SPEAKER_00] I can verify that she was the seer because I stole from her. And I switched James and Laura in attempt to recreate the drama we had last round, but differently. [SPEAKER_01] opponents acts as bosses of [SPEAKER_00] Wait, so I'm a village in there? Yes. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] And yeah, you're the robber. [SPEAKER_00] Alright. So did we kill James because he hasn't said anything else? Who would we'll pour? [SPEAKER_00] This is like a little suspicious to me that this is all just falling into play. I believe it. You said in Somniac like right away. Did you wake up as the insomniac? I woke up as the insomniac. I believe this 100% that I don't even want to take time over thinking of. Like I'm reading a vote to the left. Vote to the left, there is no where we'll. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I believe it. You said it saw me act like right away. Did you wake up as the inside of me? Yeah. Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] We're all just working together, Laura is trying to get the sus james out. [SPEAKER_00] You will [SPEAKER_00] He's a robber now not to pick on you, but to pick on you. Sorry, did it was anyone able to confirm your story or [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Let's take a closer look for more samples here. The third is Look shadows shown on which stage wears off,\u9ede Now ten on one side right here and one down here right here [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] these two and him. Yep. And you so we're a nice happy town. [SPEAKER_00] after that last yelling round. So I think we all go to the left. [SPEAKER_00] Does anyone doesn't want to go to a vote at this point? [SPEAKER_00] I think I'm kinda... Could Justin be a werewolf? I could, but I'm not. [SPEAKER_01] Cooked it. [SPEAKER_00] When did you claim to make her? I was to test her room before anyone else fascinated. I said, I'm a tolemaker and I switched James with somebody. [SPEAKER_01] I was to test before anyone. [SPEAKER_01] I said I'm a totally nice switch. [SPEAKER_00] And James then said, Billager, then Paulus and Insomniac, you said, you said, you said, see, you said, see, you're sometime in that and then you were the last to say, Robert, but you're confirming a story. So we kill Mitchell. [SPEAKER_00] That room. That room sure. [SPEAKER_00] So what are we doing? We think there are two werewolves in the middle. And you saw Villejo and Werewolf when you were seared, right? Yeah, Villejo and Werewolf. All right. I'd be ready to vote if you guys are. I'm just, honestly, now I'm worried about James, because I feel like he's just so excited. He's like silent. Because he would want to say that he isn't the Werewolf now because Laura has his card. All right, I'm good to vote to the left. And I think if someone's a Werewolf here, you won because we were all a happy, loving town. So speak up if you don't want to go to vote now. Okay, I'm going. Yes, voting time. Yeah, time is up, everyone. [SPEAKER_01] panilla [SPEAKER_01] Bye. [SPEAKER_01] That's so funny. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, I'm going. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah."}

There's no way we don't have a werewolf this round. Can you verify your story? [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Can you verify your story? I can. I'll tell you this. I know which one of you is a villager. [SPEAKER_00] one of these two. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, that's good. That's good. [SPEAKER_01] Well, it's me because I went to sleep as a villager. Could be both, we could both be villagers. This true, but then someone would have to be a wearable. I'm gonna die again. [SPEAKER_00] could be both we could both be meldors this [SPEAKER_00] I'm gonna die again. I, Justin, the way that Justin picked his possibilities and wants to add on the troublemaker was very similar to a couple of runs he did when we played last time where he was lying both times. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] up just to keep it fresh. Here's the thing. If there's a werewolf out there, they would care who you switched. Yeah, no one's asking. I don't give a fuck. I say don't say. Sure, I won't. [SPEAKER_02] And here's the thing. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] Give us \u0432\u043d\u0438\u0437 Yin\u306f\u3044\u3064s sin [SPEAKER_02] big frig limiting [SPEAKER_02] And I say... [SPEAKER_00] Don't say. [SPEAKER_01] uh, booster? your guess? no he says one more i can't switch my- oh, us as wearables yeah james is just powdery he's not saying the word in here oh, but i can't because you guys can't both be because i just thought the lesson was just a setter oh my god [SPEAKER_00] I can't switch my- [SPEAKER_02] Because... Why do you smell the muscles? Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] says you. Yes, that's me. So Paul can you [SPEAKER_01] So Paul, thank you for one of the skill where we'll... [SPEAKER_00] What if the scale wear wolf that saw a seer? [SPEAKER_01] No, I don't think James is a werewolf as turn. I'm gonna be a hunter. He also did. [SPEAKER_02] I'm gonna be a hundred percent honest with you as a serial as I can be in Somnank and Paul said is someone just honestly and that's when I like lifted the other card and booked it, Paul and set that window. I think it was brown. What? [SPEAKER_00] Why is it so pudgy?! [SPEAKER_01] Oh, there's a lot of it. Oh, good to see you. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] Oh, so we're sure I was looking at that one. Yeah, and then I went to lift that. All right, that's brief as they may believe you. Paul said that some of it all, obviously, look at it. Yeah, that's. [SPEAKER_00] \u9673\u5c31\u5509 [SPEAKER_00] Alright, that's pretty specific. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, yeah, that's a fabricated story. That's a good [SPEAKER_00] Okay, if you're not gonna say who you Who you Moved and I'm not gonna say who I robbed and either no one cares Because if you're lying or if you're lying, yeah, we rock one of you you would care if I don't care and you would care if [SPEAKER_02] Yeah [SPEAKER_02] you would care if I don't care [SPEAKER_02] I don't care. I'll go to the left. I don't know. No one needs to die. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, money going on. It's going to be like if we all vote to the left somebody's gonna find it. Probably times we've already get a vote. It's not far. [SPEAKER_01] How many times have we bought these in a lot? Twice. Twice. And then there's a way. And there's been a werewolf every time? Yeah. But it also could not be a werewolf. No we... [SPEAKER_00] We didn't vote to the left. So like I was gonna say, you got, or a giant, I killed, but we have those green ball joints. [SPEAKER_01] We have those green balls. I did switch people. I did. I'm not saying who. So if you're concerned about losing the game as a werewolf. [SPEAKER_00] As a werewolf, you should be concerned. I think you should say so that if they are... I'm not sure where we'll end up. Then they're gonna try to pin it on somebody if they know they got switched. Like I think we're not gonna get the information till you say same thing. Yeah, I know, I'm a werewolf. Same thing with the robbing, except I do, I know that my information will only protect. Oh, here's a while. [SPEAKER_01] I'm not going to say wearable. [SPEAKER_02] same thing but yeah I know I was doing the same thing with me right [SPEAKER_01] Oh, here's a, I'll just say, I'll say who, one person I did not switch with, I did not switch James. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] So we have no stress from anybody. No. Not here. [SPEAKER_01] No stress, Laura, you're happy as a villager? And yours... [SPEAKER_02] always stressed. [SPEAKER_02] All those. [SPEAKER_01] Guys anti our mouse [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Um, no I'm a villager. Yeah, I'm a villager. I have nothing that we worried about. There's just no one fighting. The only people fighting are like the troublemaker and the robbers. So I think we just vote left. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Then kill me and I'll die again and that's the life I'll leave [SPEAKER_00] Okay, I brought some Mitchell. [SPEAKER_00] So Mitchell's the rover, I'm the villager. So I can hit for him Mitchell was cool. So what if she was my only suspicion to possibly make that up for sure? [SPEAKER_02] So what if she was my only suspicion to pass that's my [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] but not aware of all. [SPEAKER_00] Because last time you were, where, where, well, if you said you were the villager. Ooh. But. Good observation. [SPEAKER_01] Good observation. Good memory. Good memory. [SPEAKER_00] Good memory. To this time, because... [SPEAKER_01] You know what you should do? Also bring your charger. Yeah, yeah, why? How does the charge? Oh, it's a specific charger. It's a pretty fast charger. Oh, how does the charger? It's the new US TV. Important things in 30 seconds. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah.. Please? Yeah, watch! [SPEAKER_00] Oh, there's a specific charger. [SPEAKER_02] So how does it show? [SPEAKER_00] It's... [SPEAKER_00] important things in 30 seconds. This is important, but not time sensitive. [SPEAKER_01] I'm gonna say if she was a werewolf and she got to look at one in the center it most likely would have been one of the two closest to her but you verified that it was [SPEAKER_01] So let's say that was a situation I think we've all left I think we've all left in my opinion We've all left [SPEAKER_00] report left.

See you. [SPEAKER_02] Where is she? [SPEAKER_03] What the- you're the Tanner maybe? Maybe you're the Tanner. Who knows? I'm a villager. Who knows? [SPEAKER_04] Who knows? I love him. [SPEAKER_04] I'm the other chick. I'm the insomniac. [SPEAKER_03] Why do you think he's lying? Because I looked at those cards. [SPEAKER_02] That's crazy because if you're a winner wolf and you fucking lied about what you are and what you saw That's like three variables that you would like only possibly have like information about one and you're like yeah I'll just do it. Which is very much though. It seems to be like your strategy. Yep. Can anyone? [SPEAKER_03] Yep, wow, can anyone verify either of these stories? We got a no one can no one can [SPEAKER_04] We got no one can no one can [SPEAKER_04] No one can verify my story because I woke up as the Insulting the Act. [SPEAKER_04] We need some more people talking. [SPEAKER_02] I can't confirm anything, glue is a troubling girl. [SPEAKER_04] Nice, got there. [SPEAKER_03] This is a dangerous round. [SPEAKER_04] I can confirm you did not switch me. [SPEAKER_02] I was like how? I understood. Because you're singing your insomniac. Hey, interesting. If... [SPEAKER_03] Hey, interesting, if he was lying. [SPEAKER_03] then he wouldn't have been able to confirm that without risk. But he said it confident. What this [SPEAKER_02] What this kind of says to me is James knows he's the Tanner. This is the possibility. He knows he's the Tanner. So he's going to say that that's one of the cards in there. Because then the Tanner's not going to lie about being, or not, if a whole game. What can I ask Laura? What's Laura? What do you know about? Yeah. Laura's in my office. [SPEAKER_01] He and Laura. [SPEAKER_04] What's Laura Laura? What do you know about? [SPEAKER_04] Here's the more volunteers there [SPEAKER_03] I think Laura might be aware of. I mean... [SPEAKER_04] I think<|az|>ya would have- Mauritius [SPEAKER_01] We're getting longer than previous light [SPEAKER_03] That's the way things are looking. But also there is this conflict we cannot ignore between stories. [SPEAKER_04] Thank you very much. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_04] \u8fa6\uc740 [SPEAKER_04] I think James might be the Tana. [SPEAKER_02] I think just in the zone. [SPEAKER_04] I am the Insomniac and I walk up the gates also. [SPEAKER_02] Welcome to the dance hall, which is really interesting because Laura may be one of the people that I swit. [SPEAKER_04] He did not switch her with me because I woke up as the insolent the act. [SPEAKER_02] That makes me believe Justin Bitt too, because actually I didn't switch Justin with her. [SPEAKER_04] How does it feel to be lying about being the bilger right now by the way? Just a see that information. [SPEAKER_03] It's just a sting on him [SPEAKER_03] Let's go. [SPEAKER_04] I was Liam Somniak, this is a problem. He's lying. No I'm not. [SPEAKER_02] I think James is the Tanner. I think James is the Tanner as well. He did that right away because he chose the Tanner as one of the cars in the center. [SPEAKER_04] I think James is the Tanner. I think James. [SPEAKER_04] And it's in the center. If Jay, I think Jay, like this is a good gambit to be as the Tanner, not as much as the werewolf because like you said, you're lying about three things. Yeah. But if he's the werewolf, it totally puts us off the track of James. [SPEAKER_02] Here's the awkward part that comes into the game. Switch James? I didn't. Switch James? I didn't switch James. So you switched Laura and Pitchel? I switched Lauren Mitchell. Thanks. The review level. [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_03] Thanks for watching. [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_03] That was a verbal. That means you are a verbal. Please tell me your... [SPEAKER_03] I think we got a kill Mitchell. I mean, I have no defense. I was a villager. [SPEAKER_04] I'm in the middle of the jerk. Suddenly, someone made some trouble and I'm aware of it. [SPEAKER_03] So it makes some trouble and I'm aware I've grown some fur [SPEAKER_04] I think we got a kill Mitchell. [SPEAKER_03] I kind of agree. Yeah. But what the fuck? [SPEAKER_02] What the fuck is Janice gonna do if we decide to kill Mitchell? He's gonna vote for me [SPEAKER_04] He's gonna vote for me. [SPEAKER_02] Okay, but he can't, okay, as a Tanner, he can't screw up the vote. If all three of us are trying to vote for the left, so you can't do that like, take us down. You can't do the micapointing? Yeah. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, but he can't, okay, as a ten- [SPEAKER_04] It's all three of us trying to vote. [SPEAKER_04] You can't do the mic plan. Yeah, cursive mic plan. Chat the mic for you. [SPEAKER_03] chapter of what? of what with you because I'm a werewolf. I'm scared. [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_04] Oh, and you can't move for yourself. [SPEAKER_01] Well, here's the thing again, because, okay, so I was a seater. Yeah. And- One minute. I'm terrible at being a seater, because last time I had forgot the first car to look- Did I? Did I? For the second car? Yeah. I forgot the first car, I looked at it, because it was like, oh, the Tanner, he's a funny guy. I saw a brown hair, could have been the robber, no one claimed him. So I'm just in story, you might very well check out, but I'm sticking to my guns and- I feel- [SPEAKER_04] Here's a... [SPEAKER_00] One minute, I'm terrible at this. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_00] The channel is funny. [SPEAKER_04] I didn't know why it's a little funny [SPEAKER_02] Why is that horrible for you? Because that's what James thinks I am. Oh, okay. Yeah, because I feel pretty good about what Justin said because we sort of like verified each other's stories based on trust. [SPEAKER_04] Oh, okay. Yeah, cuz I feel- [SPEAKER_01] I will\u4e2d 13 Well there must be blood [SPEAKER_02] also [SPEAKER_00] There must be blood. [SPEAKER_00] Rosanna You're my fault Sorry~~~~!"}

I saw a werewolf and a drunk. [SPEAKER_00] You saw a village. [SPEAKER_00] And what did you see in the middle? [SPEAKER_01] Show me. [SPEAKER_01] So one of those, we all think that one of those were sitting there. [SPEAKER_01] We all think that one of those was residing there? I like Justin's confidence. [SPEAKER_01] I think Justin is grappling for away and he's throwing me under the bus right now. I think Justin's the where we'll furniture the Tanner. [SPEAKER_00] I went just to throw away out of it and he's throwing me under the bus right now. [SPEAKER_01] Uh-huh. [SPEAKER_01] You know what I'm saying? One of us is really going to be the Tanner. Yeah. I was like, oh man, the Tanner would be great. [SPEAKER_00] One of us is really good to be the Tanner. [SPEAKER_01] No. [SPEAKER_01] This is I guarantee you this is how it is. I am so confident Oh my god, you are about to lose us the game again. No matter what anyone says my vote is Mitchell I think just I still stand by Justin Can I know why what's it? Kind of why me and I'm just throwing me under the bus right now and you are being a fucking [SPEAKER_00] I'm so confident in this. Oh my god, you are about to lose. [SPEAKER_00] Man no matter what [SPEAKER_00] kind of why [SPEAKER_00] Yes? [SPEAKER_00] I'll just take it to center group and work that. [SPEAKER_01] At the Tanner don't want to be hung right yeah, and he's been no one. Oh, he's been he's playing With you on this 100 there is a he gave no information and claiming the the seer is because he had no information He was the goddamn werewolf got this information right here [SPEAKER_00] at the time I can't even want to be home. [SPEAKER_00] come on out of the Wes the [SPEAKER_00] Can't leave that fucking girl here. He's going to posted here? It's not going to happen faster anymore. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] You also couldn't look at one of those and you were the wearable. [SPEAKER_01] It's true. It's true. Maybe he saw the other werewolf. Maybe go actually even if he saw it. James and I know. Give him a hatch like the same. I believe both of you. Well, yeah, what? Yeah, you've everybody here. I know you're telling the truth. Unless James is like just, I'm not listening to it. I hesitated the last time and I fucked the game up. I guarantee you that on we's change cards, this is what you ask me. I honestly think what's happening is we have no werewolf and Mitch is the Tanner. Okay, what if Justin could be the Tanner by claiming the same role someone else has is a great way of getting to show her. It could be, we could still win if we just say they're both the werewolf and then he turns out to be the Tanner. He might have to be the one. No, I guarantee you, Alvin. I guarantee you this is how it stands. I'm that confident. It's good. [SPEAKER_00] It's true. [SPEAKER_00] So, in this Hi do Geveno app\u2026. [SPEAKER_00] You provide history. I know. [SPEAKER_00] OS [SPEAKER_00] you [SPEAKER_00] It's very true. [SPEAKER_00] No, I can't. [SPEAKER_01] I think one of them is a tenor. So, if I was a seer and he was a tenor, that would be a great opportunity to say, after I said I'm a seer, he goes, wait, I'm a seer, and then there's suspicion. So that could be an attempt to be a tenor. Why is it my first? In all fairness, a seer is also a good one when someone has already claimed something to verify someone else's story. If, and then I did earlier, and got me a lot of heat. If I was a werewolf, that means that I claimed seer before I heard what everyone else said. That means I would... I heard what we both said. Yeah, and he used me to verify. Whatever it is, they're not both werewolves because they're fighting. So I guarantee you it's Mitchell as a werewolf and just, I don't know what the fuck Justin is. I still can't believe it. So we're talking about what you think he is. Yeah, that fits with that. So I think it's a good one for one. All right, we got a boat right away. We're going for Justin, I think. Wow, it's Justin and he made you a sucker for it. It's Mitchell. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] I said mine first. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_00] When you heard about we both said yeah [SPEAKER_00] Whatever it is. [SPEAKER_00] I still feel like it's so we're talking what you think he is. Yeah, he fits with that. So I think he's going to vote for one. All right, we got a vote right away for Justin, I think. Wow. It's Justin. [SPEAKER_01] What's our reveal? What's the chat thing? It's a chat thing. It's a time we both die. Why do you both die? Because the tide both people die. [SPEAKER_00] See you later. [SPEAKER_01] How many fuck does I told you to fuck us? There's no more talking. It's over. Show reveal. Mitch would get chosen because Justin would be tanning them because he would win so you don't hang them. So no matter what you hang Mitch. Show reveal. [SPEAKER_00] D'uh, hi. Keep it up to fucking. [SPEAKER_01] J three, two, one, two, one. One, two, one. Two, four, three, one. One, two, one, two, one. Two, four, three, one. I like the combat. I hate the combat. That's because that's a long story. That's a long story. I like the combat. [SPEAKER_01] I thought you were too obvious to be a child. I thought you were too obvious to be a child. I'm so sorry that I did this to you, my astral. I told you! [SPEAKER_00] I'm so sorry [SPEAKER_01] No werewolves. I thought there was way too. How rude. I thought there's no werewolves, but I was a werewolf. I guarantee that I was so confident there. I totally thought I was meant to on the other guy. There's no way you would actually be the werewolf. [SPEAKER_00] I thought there was way to have room with that [SPEAKER_00] I was never too obvious. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, got me. Alright, so I'm liking it. I'm liking going dark. I totally over thought that Can you like? No, I did not do a good job there. I thought you were like Jim's happy to sign your left hand on my table. Like so, like minus?

[SPEAKER_00] Thanks for watching. [SPEAKER_01] Who is this? Don't worry about it, James. Who is it? Who is it? Who's gonna go into this? Alright guys, we're going dark.

[SPEAKER_00] Alright, we're going dark again. What? [SPEAKER_01] everyone how who [SPEAKER_01] Oh, Christ. I'm pissed because I was the drunk and the last one. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] for other werewolves. If there is only one werewolf, you may look at a card from the center. [SPEAKER_00] Where will close your eyes? See you. Wake up. [SPEAKER_00] You may look at another player's card, or two of the center cards. [SPEAKER_00] See her, close your eyes. [SPEAKER_01] Robert [SPEAKER_00] Wake up. [SPEAKER_00] You may exchange your card with another player's card, and then view your new card. [SPEAKER_00] Robert, close your eyes. Tor. [SPEAKER_00] wake up and exchange your card with a card from the center. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Close your eyes. Everyone, keep your eyes closed and reach out and move your card around. This is like... [SPEAKER_00] Wake up! [SPEAKER_01] I just want everyone to know I haven't open up my eyes a bit early just to turn the webcam back on Oh, so everybody knows all right. How is everybody's night? [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Good. [SPEAKER_01] Listen none of us talk for this whole one. And we just bought it. Well wait for James's gut to tell us who to vote for. Yeah, who do you think you should vote for, James? [SPEAKER_00] And we just bought it. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, without even saying anything else, just throw a name out there. [SPEAKER_01] So happy. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, does anyone want to be the first one to dock? I have an idea. Yeah, I can tell you guys why I have that idea afterwards. [SPEAKER_00] Have a nice day. [SPEAKER_01] after when. [SPEAKER_00] at being just as the role. [SPEAKER_01] This is just how I'm gonna skip what you're gonna have confident are you? [SPEAKER_01] I'd say an eight. That's not a 10 which it should be. Why do you think this? Why do you think this is? [SPEAKER_00] How do you think this? [SPEAKER_01] How was there a robber? [SPEAKER_01] Was there a rumour? [SPEAKER_01] I may or may not be a robber. [SPEAKER_01] Alright, so exactly where we were before you answer that question. [SPEAKER_01] Ellen, can I know why you think I am the werewolf? How's this here? Okay. [SPEAKER_00] That beautiful life? And it will be not an hour ago. [SPEAKER_01] Okay. [SPEAKER_01] Well, I'm suspicious with Mitch, because I was the ropper. [SPEAKER_00] time [SPEAKER_01] I think Mitch was the drunk. And I can confirm Alvin's story. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Okay, so now you're saying you're currently the seer. Yeah. Okay. [SPEAKER_01] Did you rob me? So you robbed me? So they're robbing me? I'm the seeer. And then Mitch, using what I know, says he could... James' story doesn't make sense. [SPEAKER_01] What is that? Why? DREAM? What? You fucking... What? [SPEAKER_01] Tell your story again, one more time, exactly what you told me first time. [SPEAKER_01] You're a rover in the beginning? Come on, rover. [SPEAKER_00] they could both be invited [SPEAKER_01] Why did you start this tangent and then not end it? [SPEAKER_01] Why? It's due to the lion's eye, you shit. No! Were you the robber? [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] I was the robber. No, see that's why I said I was the robber and take issue with that. When you said you were the robber, because I'm the... I was the fucking robber. You were the robber. I was the robber. [SPEAKER_00] I was the fucking robber. [SPEAKER_01] The only thing that in my mind this question is that there's more than one more of us. I think there are two. I'm quite... I know one person's line. [SPEAKER_00] \u043c\u0438 [SPEAKER_01] It's throwing lots of hate out. Well look, I'll tell you what I think is happening. I think we're all aware of. [SPEAKER_00] I'll be right back. [SPEAKER_01] I think you might be either the drunk or the Tanner Mitch. I was the robber. [SPEAKER_01] That's a fucking one. That's how I know he's lying. What would he do? God damn it, man. You're right. Why do you rub? [SPEAKER_00] That's a fucking... That's... [SPEAKER_00] God damn it, man. Why are you... Why are you... [SPEAKER_01] And that's why I don't have that much information. [SPEAKER_01] So if you robbed him, it won't stop me. [SPEAKER_00] So if you robbed him, it won't sound me. [SPEAKER_01] He's exactly what he claims he was. Well, that was a bit of hesitation there. Yeah. Not even a solid answer. I go with James on this one. Here's another thing that could have happened. Say I was the werewolf. Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_00] Not even a song of answer. [SPEAKER_01] What if James... [SPEAKER_01] is the router. [SPEAKER_01] Alright, what if James is not the Robert? Let's just say that. What if Mitch was the Robert, okay? [SPEAKER_01] situation what if one of them said rob you not use the werewolf and he's trying to hop on this trick it could it could be did all that for either of them correct if I if I am the werewolf are you crobert like you you agree that you were the werewolf it could be getting i'm not going to say anything because i [SPEAKER_00] one of them less [SPEAKER_00] on this track. [SPEAKER_00] If I am the world. [SPEAKER_00] I'm not gonna say any- [SPEAKER_01] You know, I don't even know if I want to believe you as the seer. I don't want to know if I believe you as a robber. You as the robber? I can verify as a seer. And so that's what I mean. I'm quite confident that you would be a werewolf. Remember when Mitchell said he's exactly the same. And I know he's lying. So in my eyes, it's kind of like a, it's black and white here. I think it's just in then, unless I'm listening. I think we have two werewolves. [SPEAKER_00] alright [SPEAKER_00] And so that was the idea. [SPEAKER_00] Remember be aware of it. [SPEAKER_00] And I know he's lying. [SPEAKER_00] I think we are... [SPEAKER_01] So well, actually the only one I know for a fact is Justin because through you, I think you're the Tanner and you're trying desperately to get us to kill you. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, James also also declared that you were that album was out here no confirmed Alibis I think as well. I know it was Justin whether or not someone else moved it or there's a second where will I don't know [SPEAKER_00] 20 seconds left. I think it's that wall. [SPEAKER_01] So you know Justin was a wearable. Yeah. And so someone. So then here's the thing, if I'm the wearable, why are they both declaring Robert? Because there's a second wearable fear. So which one is it? [SPEAKER_00] And so someone says, so then here's the thing. [SPEAKER_00] Lockas. [SPEAKER_00] So which one? [SPEAKER_01] So you're here? So you're here admitting you are a werewolf? Well then I want to know which one of you's the Tanner. That's I, I'm all men in the world. But I want to know which one of you's going to lose along, you know. No, one of us is a werewolf, one of us is a robber. We're both cloning the robber here. We're pretty confident. [SPEAKER_00] So you're admitting you are aware, Will? [SPEAKER_00] a sugar [SPEAKER_00] No, it's one of- [SPEAKER_00] We're both clean and we're here. We're pretty confident."}

[SPEAKER_01] Make it right, but I'm in the robber's touch, give it that. [SPEAKER_00] Trouble maker close your eyes [SPEAKER_00] Everyone, keep your eyes closed and reach out and move your corner out slightly. [SPEAKER_01] This is my favorite part. Yeah.

[SPEAKER_01] Next time we play, I can shorten the time that he gives everyone. Sure, you get more time with it. We're going to miss it. Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] you get more to doing that with it. [SPEAKER_01] Let's get some information flow in here. [SPEAKER_01] Alright, you're gonna start? You're the one on the fucking I started as a villager. [SPEAKER_00] I just hear the water on the fucking- [SPEAKER_01] That's what I was. That's what I was, too. I didn't know her. Really? I kept my eyes close the whole time. Really? Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Really? I'm coming. [SPEAKER_01] and chat it, that chat is a little, that's because I'm not a good village, I don't sleep at night. It's funny, I say that because as the troublemaker, I switch to your guys' cards. [SPEAKER_01] Okay. [SPEAKER_01] What why that was a I was a villager so You're a villager. Okay, so this I'm always a We're all lying I'm not lying [SPEAKER_00] You know You are really rich OK, so this fuck with your wearable Wlying [SPEAKER_01] But then he switched, he switched. I switched these two, yeah. Yeah. So if Mitch is the werewolf, I'm probably the werewolf, and I don't know, but Owlin's also a liar. So I'm back to Mitch all being the werewolf. Oh, fine. Unless Mitch is lying about being a village here. [SPEAKER_00] I switched these two, yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Well, TikTok. Now I feel like I don't wanna get gang. But okay, if one of you guys was the werewolf, in which it was Mitchell, I absolutely know it was. Then you guys would, where you say it. No, why would be it? I was the werewolf. [SPEAKER_00] one of you guys was? [SPEAKER_00] That's what it was. Then you guys would, or you say it out. [SPEAKER_01] I guess they're not well. Calvin. What? I'm over you! [SPEAKER_01] Billinger. Billinger. Yeah. It's where the trouble maker and I switch. I think Mitchell's lying because I think it was the world. I think we should gank me. [SPEAKER_00] And Bill and Jerry. Bill and Jerry. Yeah. We're at the trouble maker and I switch. It's all new. [SPEAKER_01] I think we should vote for James. James has been lying this whole time. We should gank me. I think Justin, because nobody's been doing anything with Justin. He's a troublemaker. He switched us. I believe that to a T. [SPEAKER_00] We should have been lying this whole time. [SPEAKER_00] music for [SPEAKER_01] Okay, no one cast that on until this moment. I refuse to back down. Maybe we don't have, note we have to have a werewolf because three people have claimed villager. [SPEAKER_01] Kind of a robber and a seer. Wait, who did you... No, they would all claim it because robbers and seers are on the village's team. I think we should gang to eat seriously. [SPEAKER_00] No, they would all... [SPEAKER_01] 24 hours. That gives you things you were the werewolf. I literally think we should kill me. What happens if times run out and we don't? We just have to vote immediately. It'll say like at the end of the day like 3, 2, 1 vote we all just point it with. We have a lot of people on the queue. You're gonna see you. I vote James. I think it's Justin. I don't know why. I don't know why. [SPEAKER_00] What do you want? I can see the things [SPEAKER_00] What happens if time runs out and we don't, we just... [SPEAKER_00] atin [SPEAKER_00] so now he warns you. [SPEAKER_01] That's where I was on the first round, but no evidence. [SPEAKER_01] No, I swapped their roles around. Yeah, okay. [SPEAKER_01] Uh, I don't know. I think it's James. Do you want to do the vote then? He just thinks it's him? I think it's me. Shall we vote? Shall we go to vote? Yeah."}

This is my family. [SPEAKER_03] You Fun! I miss you guys more! [SPEAKER_00] Slightly [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_04] slightly i'm moving my mind off like so much [SPEAKER_03] I'm not flying so much. [SPEAKER_04] I'm just gonna go out on the left and say there's no where we'll clear. We're happy Village. [SPEAKER_02] I'm gonna go out of a win and say it's Justin. You know, it would make it happen. It would make it happen cause we were having... [SPEAKER_04] You know, it would make sense. It's Alvin because we were a happy village so someone's throwing heat. I'm usually the one who gets it twice in a row, but this time I am a villager. [SPEAKER_02] Well, let me put it this way. Did you swap? Yeah. Justins. [SPEAKER_02] Because I'm the seer that I looked at it and he's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_04] I'm a village rather than nothing. I thought we were a happy village. Where will we save that? We will save that, yeah. [SPEAKER_01] A werewolf would say that. I'm not saying that. Unless someone else was the seer. But if there was one werewolf, he got a look. Maybe he saw the seer. Maybe he's clean. Maybe. So I think it's either Justin. Maybe. What are you, man? Or Alvin. I'm just a villager. [SPEAKER_03] maybe what are you doing? [SPEAKER_04] Or Alvin. I'm just a villager. Ooh. We have a problem. [SPEAKER_02] Walkers [SPEAKER_02] Are you guys at both villages? [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. None of you switched any cards. No. Okay, so now it's like a trust thing. It is. I was right the first two times. You're gonna trust me on a third one. No, because you're throwing out the trust card. All right, that's cool. So you were a seer. Yeah. I straight up looked at his card and it was the werewolf card. So unless one of you guys switched it around. I believe in. [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_01] No. [SPEAKER_01] So now it's like a trusting it is [SPEAKER_03] I believe in. [SPEAKER_04] I don't even have photos still in the wearable. [SPEAKER_03] Why no where hey waffles how's it going James? [SPEAKER_02] Hey, Waffle House, how's it going? James, let's take a random thing and just take a look. [SPEAKER_01] If there is no werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] Why would Elbin lie? If he's on the villager team, why would he lie? [SPEAKER_01] You're right, he's a werewolf. It's gotta be one of those two. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_04] I can't it be you though because we don't have any villager tokens left [SPEAKER_01] Well, you see, the tokens are just fucking... You're talking to me. Now, then, do you trust me? Now you fucking dumb shit. What do we just lose? [SPEAKER_04] What are you just doing? You get too well of talking to me. Oh shit, that's a small... [SPEAKER_03] Sweet Drugin 1027. Thank you so much for following us. Welcome to the table. [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_01] I think Mike's the werewolf. Mike's the werewolf. Maybe rage. [SPEAKER_02] my step to the world. Maybe rage. I think it could be Mitch, like if there's a second werewolf, it could be like any of us. I guarantee you. I know adjusting me. I know adjusting me. [SPEAKER_01] I guarantee I know it's not the world. But it could be more than one. If there's a second world, if he's telling the truth and he's a world wolf and there's a second world wolf, he would be defending Justin. Except it could be... What if they're both world wolves? [SPEAKER_01] they want target they would know he would know each other and they've already put targets on both their backs i don't think they're both were wolves [SPEAKER_00] There was no way.. [SPEAKER_04] Welcome to the No Target near some of my there is believe I'm a village. Yeah [SPEAKER_01] There is believe I'm a failure. [SPEAKER_01] You haven't shown an ounce of strategy yet. That's usually... [SPEAKER_04] That's usually James's strategy, no, Thanos. [SPEAKER_02] James is a strategy in the alphanus. It could be, I think, just, well, I know it's just the world, but I think maybe... I'm gonna trust Alvin. It's just, yeah, because I like, let's go to a vote. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, cuz I like [SPEAKER_01] Let's go to a vote. I'm gonna trust Albin too. Okay, ready? Yeah [SPEAKER_03] "}

[SPEAKER_01] I'm just gonna throw it out there and I want to bet. [SPEAKER_01] You're a villager. Hi, what are you going off of? [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] God I'll see your eyes without any signal good to know my just want us to wave with him I wanted to bet that there's probably yeah, too where we'll this is how I see this playing So you that is just pure gut. Yeah fucking gut fucking gut Prove me wrong Mitchell. I have no information because that was a villager [SPEAKER_00] You can all see your eyes without- [SPEAKER_00] how I see this playing. So that is [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] We have a village. I was a village. Mitchell, why? I was a villager when I started, but maybe someone swapped it. You were a villager when you started? No one else. You were claiming villager when you started? Yeah. I got up. So I know in my head that one of you were lying. So I know for a fact there's a werewolf here. I think it's James. Oh, it's Alvin. [SPEAKER_00] We have the village in Athens. I'm saying that that was the ability. Mitchell Y. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Unless someone switched it again and like I'm like a werewolf. I'm not gonna cool. I'm not gonna pull a Mitchell. I was the robber [SPEAKER_00] usu [SPEAKER_01] And I switched with one of you guys. What did you switch with? And what did you get? I want to know if there was a seer or troublemaker involved as well. I'm not going to go all the way. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Until I get some there was a werewolf there's one villager because they're both claiming villager I'm gonna say one of them probably is a war of villager and one of them's a war I can be the wherewolf You switch with me and no wait cuz the robber knows yeah Cool, we'll play well. Yeah, we'll play some other character cards after this round. He knows it [SPEAKER_00] % [SPEAKER_00] I want one of them to wear a Cuando. I can even eat a- [SPEAKER_01] So you're a villager, I think. I'm a villager. No way. No, I'm a, I was started a villager. Let's take this. One of them is a robber. And one of them, Justin. The one Justin did not switch with is the werewolf. Well, last time Justin was like, I'm this. He just absolutely wasn't a robber. Pass games are forgotten. But if, if, if, if, if James started the werewolf, and I, [SPEAKER_00] The one testing. [SPEAKER_00] Remember, Kleinwa? This video is sponsored by Mc \u0648\u00e4s \u05de\u0131ndlement and microsale www.pSaandHeoD [SPEAKER_00] That it was not. The past games were forgotten. But that's it. [SPEAKER_00] started the villager. But if you're half, then it was James, then Justin might be the world. [SPEAKER_01] What did you just have to? [SPEAKER_01] He might be, but he said he will reveal who he's switched with as long as there's not a troublemaker here. So I think Justin's confident with what he has. I think that what happened was he switched with the villager, whoever that was. Yeah. And now he wants to make sure there's not a troublemaker so that he knows he truly is on the good side at this point. The question is, which one of you fuckers was lying at the beginning? And she'll start on a lot of heat out of this. [SPEAKER_00] Do I think? [SPEAKER_01] And Justin has the answer, whichever one Justin did switch with is the werewolf. I'll come, he didn't switch with you. [SPEAKER_01] How come Justin didn't switch with me? Yeah, you're all in line with our task. [SPEAKER_01] Well, I'm just saying what I know from my head and I know my villager. All of the time it didn't start song. Both. Yeah, but you were very quick to see you were villager. Because I'm a fucking villager. You don't have to forget to claim I'm a villager. Who do you think is? Because I trusted you wholeheartedly in this one. [SPEAKER_00] Because I'm a fucking villain. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Do you want to save when you swap with? [SPEAKER_01] Why why no first if there was a troublemaker why was a villager I was a villager I was a Would a troublemaker admit that there was a troublemaker with so no one was a sear and no one was a troublemaker now [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Would a troublemaker [SPEAKER_00] So no one was a- [SPEAKER_01] No one's admitting to it. [SPEAKER_01] Why would they lie? [SPEAKER_01] What are there's two levels that spills guys? [SPEAKER_01] And then you I don't think they would lie. I don't think there is a I'll say who I switched with I switched with album you fucking were all son of a bitch. Yeah, he's I know I'm not a werewolf because I'm a seer [SPEAKER_00] I'll save you, I swear. [SPEAKER_01] The two mental cards What were the two? Okay, so I know there's a werewolf and a troublemaker in there [SPEAKER_00] So I'm not going to let you know. [SPEAKER_01] Your story has totally changed. I think your story has to go to a vote? Yeah, I think so, because I think it's Mitch. You think it's Mitch? Yeah. Oh, I think it's James. James just got a board with voting framing. I think because I thought it was you from the fucking get go. [SPEAKER_00] yeah [SPEAKER_00] Look at the mids, yeah. [SPEAKER_00] I think it's just... [SPEAKER_01] It's either you or there's no where I was just a tree of banoachs It can be But I know there's a werewolf in there because I was a fucking c.I. I know there's a troublemaker in a werewolf [SPEAKER_00] Thank you so much. [SPEAKER_00] I know actually can be but I know this world [SPEAKER_01] So you're this, I'm this. Yeah, because we switch. And then, No, this is easier. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] No, I'm not leaving. This is your... [SPEAKER_01] So you saw two cards and what did you see? I saw a werewolf and a troublemaker. You saw a werewolf and troublemaker. So it is possible there's two werewolves. If he's telling the truth, he's a seer. If he's telling a lie, he's a werewolf. Maybe we don't have a werewolf this time. Yes, yes. That's what I'm saying. Like if you're telling the truth, then there's two werewolves in here. If you're telling a werewolf. We have 15 seconds. I think it's Mitch. He's kind of grasping the werewolves. I think it's James. I think it's Mitch. What are we going to do with a tag right here? I don't know. We'll have to find out. Oh, okay. So. How long? Why do you think it's me? All right. Well, that's all that's vote. I don't know why. Yeah. Because like, Yeah, tell him you saw. [SPEAKER_00] We have 15 seconds. I think it's Mitch. He's he's can't grasp. We have to but I think I think it's the where I think it's James. I think it's Mitch"}

[SPEAKER_00] I don't know what that is. [SPEAKER_01] Wait, a bit longer. For what? Why? I'll just tell you you were not drunk. You and I both know whether that's a lie. That's a- [SPEAKER_00] That's a long face if I've ever seen one. Albin knows- [SPEAKER_01] Albin knows whether I'm lying or not. How did the 10% I did see a lot.

[SPEAKER_00] Albin, it's sorry, it's one player card or two in the middle, right? Yes, here. Yeah. Albin. [SPEAKER_01] Yes, here. [SPEAKER_00] Which one did you switch with when you were the drunk? [SPEAKER_00] in the middle. Yeah. What? How come you're just a villager? [SPEAKER_00] Because I am. How do I even believe that? Because I'm the one leading the conversation and asking the question.

No, slow rolling is keeping information but holding certain bits of it back. Which is what he was doing. [SPEAKER_01] I don't know...

Good morning, everyone. [SPEAKER_02] I can mind you, real hunter. [SPEAKER_02] I know he was the hunter because that was the seer and I saw he was the hunter. [SPEAKER_01] could possibly just not have firewalls? Like I know as a hunter, that's something I shouldn't. Let's just look at what we got so far, step by step. So the end of the reason they would be lying in this manner that works with each other. They're both the werewolf, but I was the robber. I was only the villager. I was the robber, and I swapped with Elvin. [SPEAKER_00] I know the f**k! It sounds a little yellowish legs! [SPEAKER_00] Unless we're with each other. They're both the werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] So if that's true, you would be able to verify his story and he's verifying his story. Yes. And I'm feeling... Without a verify story. [SPEAKER_02] Yes. [SPEAKER_02] I think Justin's a dendom was a little timely, so it could be Justin, line up. [SPEAKER_01] good be but I like Mitchell's old not pair by you yeah but if you get me it's just it's a 50-50 whether I'm aware of it if that's where we're at so I'm a hunter well I'll take my shot [SPEAKER_02] or **** [SPEAKER_00] Ugh, I can't. [SPEAKER_02] But if you get me... [SPEAKER_02] I'm a hunter. Well, I'll take my shot at the store. Just in the story. But we could... [SPEAKER_01] But we could all... Do you think it both do it? So like, are you saying that you're not the seer? Because I'm confirming that you are. I have a seer. Yeah, I'm with you on that. I'm with you on that. You were the seer. You saw me. [SPEAKER_02] And then you were the seer, but you saw me do the thing. I said I was the seer, so... [SPEAKER_01] That's fair, that's fair. I was, as always, you know, with a robber, it's nice to wait and lay it tactically. I admit that. I did that because, you know... [SPEAKER_01] I wanted to set it up beforehand. [SPEAKER_01] You don't have to trust me, it's fine. I trust you. Uh-huh. And I trust James. Let's go, Mitch. [SPEAKER_01] So here I am with a completely unverified story. I have no information to give up. [SPEAKER_01] I'll end claiming I'm a villager. [SPEAKER_01] I don't know what to do then. [SPEAKER_02] I don't know if we do that. We're absolutely would do it. It's almost too convenient though. It's like maybe he's just a little bit more. We might... [SPEAKER_01] We may not have a word of all for this time. [SPEAKER_02] But I still think it's just for some reason. [SPEAKER_01] What if it's these two fuckers? I was just saying he was a seer. Let's let's Watch that scene so you can be a combo of two goers. I just got 100. No, I'm a hunter. [SPEAKER_02] Let's... let's... What? That's a... It can be a condo of two... [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] \u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b [SPEAKER_01] And I was up for my test so I'm gonna pick my own [SPEAKER_02] Well that's why when I was in the C-Rite Check here is because I wanted to see your actual time in it. Yeah, but that could be. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, but that could be so it is possible from your perspective and from mine that they're both were well Yeah, I think I'm so finding shots at you just so you know you gotta come on I am in a bad spot. I will lie about that [SPEAKER_02] I'm so far. [SPEAKER_00] You gotta come on. I am in a bad [SPEAKER_01] I'm believing what, like, I'm like, you know, I don't know if anyone is actually aware of here, right? Need the dry. Yeah. Well, I think it is, if anyone... [SPEAKER_00] I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. [SPEAKER_02] I think if anyone I was it's Mitchell. I think it's Justin because I think if Justin is like mission where he could Mitch just kind of let it sit there and it turns out that like he's the only villager [SPEAKER_00] Justin is like a mission where... [SPEAKER_01] You could have missed just... [SPEAKER_01] What if, what if, it's not where I am. Ellen Brady's a good point. I don't know why I didn't see this. No one has verified Justin's story. I just as un-fairified as his story. Yeah, it's true. No, he did say that earlier. You're the one who said you're the only un-bearable. Yeah, I did. Therefore, verifying his. I'll be it, if we're going to put me on the table for my story coming after Elvin's story, Elvin's story came after James's story. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah so [SPEAKER_00] landed [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, so therefore [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] But his story is verified in theory by you. By me. So I'm verified. Jesus' story. Yes. So verified, verified, not quite verified. Why would you lie about me? Like, no one is seniors. No one is a preacher. That's all I'm saying. [SPEAKER_02] by me. So I'm there to find Jesus' story. Yes. [SPEAKER_02] Like no one is seniors. It's true. That's all I'm saying. So why would you lie to verify me if you don't? I want to win. [SPEAKER_01] I want to win as a townspeak because I got your seer. [SPEAKER_02] We're seer. I think it's Justin. [SPEAKER_01] I don't. I believe my knowledge, you know when his town because I He's all over you to verify yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah So I mean it's possible. There's no where-wolds, but I think we have to kill and we haven't done it yet I think it's well there's no Hunter I believe you've been double [SPEAKER_02] can I go inside please, can I walk in here? [SPEAKER_02] He's good to verify. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] We haven't done it yet. I think it's well. There's no one else. I guarantee you on the Hunter. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Justin. Ah, yeah, I think we should vote Justin. Why don't we just think it's a slide? [SPEAKER_01] It's either Justin or it's me or there's no werewolves [SPEAKER_01] I don't think there are werewolves. There's hasn't been any holes in anyone's story so far that's been glaring. [SPEAKER_01] I'm a villager, I'm like, no, I don't have my sleep in over here. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] I didn't know how I was. [SPEAKER_02] But I think that seems like too easy though, so I think I think it's Justin [SPEAKER_01] But I was, I don't know just the way you're coming out. I've been in the car for the second time. Talking decision by now. [SPEAKER_01] He's my top. I think we're all villagers. I think we're all on the side of the village. We have an opportunity here to all win. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

Because I like corroborated Mitchell's story before he even said anything about it. So that's why I'm saying that. I will stand by this. Yeah. I mean, like, if I'm a werewolf and I'm trying to work with James and I together, I'm doing a poor job. So if we vote for James. [SPEAKER_02] Jertian Navajo [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] I will stand by this. [SPEAKER_03] Because I have no way to switch the card. I'm coming here as a seer. He could be the drunk. Which ones do you look at again? I looked at just his card. Just his... [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] I looked at just his card. [SPEAKER_02] Yes, and what and I said I don't I suddenly don't think you're seer [SPEAKER_02] And he said where was? He said where was. [SPEAKER_03] and he said where was? He said where was. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] What are they both werewolves? [SPEAKER_03] Well then if we vote for James, which I will vote along with, then villagers would win. Then villagers would win. [SPEAKER_02] No, no, because he wouldn't throw hate at me if we were both aware of every because we look at each other as were Because I'm telling you that's a werewolf card [SPEAKER_03] Because I'm telling them all that to wear- [SPEAKER_01] of [SPEAKER_03] You know you're a werewolf. You're admitting you know where the other werewolf is. And looking at like this, if James and I were the werewolf and we went to a vote him and I would need to cooperate on a 50-50 chance of who we were gonna vote with in unison to make it so that we would type a vote. So there'd be no point in having to go on the title. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah\u3063\u3068 [SPEAKER_02] and look at the [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_00] No point in a word on the side, though. [SPEAKER_03] The if I think it's we part our ways and I think everyone dies. Oh, I think I'm a tie like no one wins. What the fuck are you virgin losers playing? Oh, Ravary 69. I'd like the 69. Case of a tie, I'll play as time with the most votes that I'll reveal their cards. [SPEAKER_02] I think everyone... [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] The case of a tie-off player's time with the [SPEAKER_02] I really put myself off in a poor position here by admitting I'm the world and no him after the world and I just didn't think that through at all. You thought someone else was the... I can't... [SPEAKER_01] I kind of forgot that I would still lose if they killed the other criminal. Damn it. James, I was just trying to figure out who would possibly take that card and kill them instead of me. [SPEAKER_02] But even if they killed them you lose. I forgot, can we just do this whole thing? [SPEAKER_03] you largest piece of chicken on the floor. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_03] No, I was just kidding. Just saying we just vote. No, I don't know. Do you think we should keep talking or? [SPEAKER_01] L [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I think we just burned J.A. I'm telling myself [SPEAKER_02] Three."}

I want to just say this perfectly straight, perfectly honest. [SPEAKER_00] Oh my god, fun! [SPEAKER_00] Oh, man. [SPEAKER_00] One. [SPEAKER_01] I can confirm James Loseville will do it at the start. Thank you. [SPEAKER_01] That means you are a seer. Or he was a robber? Oh, possibly. Or... [SPEAKER_00] That means you are a seer. [SPEAKER_00] So [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] or they're both wearable? How could you, you can't be a Tanner. [SPEAKER_00] We're moving. [SPEAKER_01] Ah. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] But Mitch could also want to doubt. Well Mitch hasn't done anything that suspicious. I'm just gonna say Mitch is pretty long and just doesn't fucking does things. No, any of you. Okay, that reasonable yes. I'm a villager. If I am a effective villager, this is how Justin would know that. Do we have a seer? The other way, just throwing it out there, not trying to be malicious. Is it your guess? That's true, but it is malicious. You're literally calling us werewolves and all fairness. You know, it depends how you feel about that. If it's malicious. Was there a seer? I was a seer. Do you claim it to be a robber? I'm claiming to be a robber. Did you look at anyone's cart? I looked at James's cart. Was that a villager? You were a villager. [SPEAKER_00] O m\u00fc\u00e7esinde al\u0131n. [SPEAKER_00] ich muss fern reflectionen [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_00] You're a guest, see that's true, but it is. [SPEAKER_00] Was there a... [SPEAKER_00] Was that a villager? [SPEAKER_01] So as it stands, but then again, this is this, we just got to talk. But as it stands, this, Elvin is also, you know, just talking a few rounds ago, but he like that. Yes. I don't like that. [SPEAKER_00] office [SPEAKER_00] \u651dMr Senter we knew I did a view whow CHOMB c i [SPEAKER_00] But he wants that. Yes. [SPEAKER_01] I don't like that. Not at all. Let me just say that again. He could want that. That's why he could be playing that. [SPEAKER_00] Let me just turn it on again. [SPEAKER_01] That's not good. If we just kill Mitchell. Yeah, it's come Mitchell. [SPEAKER_00] You move, you just... [SPEAKER_01] I literally haven't said anything yet. I double wear wool. You're double. You're double. This is how we're looking. What were you? I was drunk. OK, so you were wear wool. It was crazy drunk. So you're wear wool now. No, no, necessarily. But odds are, I mean, it's two thirds chance. Which is a wear wool. Nothing in Alvin and James are both wear wools. That's rude. The fur-wired plaid. Yes, the plaid hate. It is. Can anyone verify a Justin story? Yes. [SPEAKER_00] I double [SPEAKER_00] You're done. You're a little bit more. This is how we're looking. [SPEAKER_00] two thirds [SPEAKER_00] We're wearing plaid. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] I can. He's a very fast yes. Well the reason he can is because the first thing I said was I can confirm James' is a villager. Yep. And Elbin confirmed that with his possible seer or werewolf. I can confirm that Justin confirmed me properly. So he was one of these two items. [SPEAKER_00] right at hands no [SPEAKER_00] Oh, the reason... [SPEAKER_01] But he's close to the wrong. But Justin's not... Justin is not... [SPEAKER_00] and he's cleaning the rock. But Justin's not... [SPEAKER_01] Ooh. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, Justin was a seer. Wait, I always forget that a werewolf can look at one here and really narrow it down. Wait, Justin was a seer. And all fairness, how would I? That's really narrowing it down. That's a reach. Okay. Well, the one just said was the robber and he knows you're the villager because he took your car. I know. I'm saying that to happen. I know, but I'm also... What if? What then what were you before? [SPEAKER_00] Okay, Justin was a seer. [SPEAKER_00] Just as a seer. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, well then we'll just type what you drop. [SPEAKER_00] Studios [SPEAKER_01] I was the robber. I really was... I was the robber before? [SPEAKER_01] So you're the scene James I am currently a villager if [SPEAKER_00] building [SPEAKER_01] No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, you were a robber and you stole someone's wear wolf. You're a current wear wolf. You didn't, and I just trusted you. How would I know you were a villager though? Because you just, how would I know you were a villager? I don't know. I just, I suddenly don't trust you. I think it's the law of the camp. Okay, these motherfuckers are being super clad into you. I'm trying to see someone put a hole in their story. That's what I'm looking for. I'm trying to see Mitchell. Okay, let's say there's one wear wolf on the board. Let's just pretend there's one wear wolf on the board. It doesn't matter what these fuckers are. And you're fucking drunk. Like, there's a good chance here there are wear wolf or a Tanner. Right? Yeah, so if I'm a Tanner, I win the game if you guys vote for me. I'm just going to go for a wear wolf. Okay, I was voting for a night. I was voting for a man. I was actually a robber. [SPEAKER_00] I know your ability. I don't know. [SPEAKER_00] I think it's the law of the camp. [SPEAKER_00] I'm trying to see someone who put a hole in the... [SPEAKER_00] I'm\u1ea5n, [SPEAKER_00] or a tan. [SPEAKER_00] so ... [SPEAKER_00] You found a werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, what did you see you for life? That's how you're okay. He just said he's the robber. I am the robber. I'm going for Alvin now because I was the robber at the start of the Goal and I don't know why but I suspect Justin. I feel like he's doing something trick. No, no It's these motherfuckers are both werewolves. I promise you that with me. Oh wish one. Mitchell. Mitchell. Yeah sure. Okay Well, wait, I started off as the drunk. I freely amiss that I Want to see that's a gamble if it's this then I win the game Yeah, and I've been I said he was a villager from the start of the game if I have to place my back I think this is I think this is how we're standing yeah, I think I think I think Might be a scene voting Alvin no No, no no no no, no no no no he's fucking with okay changes later off completely speeches [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, what? So what did you steal from life? That's how you reveal it. Okay, he just said he's the robber? I am the robber, Mitch. [SPEAKER_00] And mostly I don't know why [SPEAKER_00] I promise you that with me. [SPEAKER_00] Keep it. One way. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] This one is... [SPEAKER_00] I don't know if I'm gonna tell Flus is saying, but Elvin just, Elvin just, let's just say she was the robber. [SPEAKER_00] If I have to place my bads, if I have to place my bads, I think. [SPEAKER_00] I'm gonna have to live here. [SPEAKER_00] No no no no no! He's fucking with it! He changes his name to Rock!

[SPEAKER_02] How can you verify it? [SPEAKER_01] and this is the standing just like you and I last time. And the fuck does. Salmon don't fuck me. [SPEAKER_02] Hello, I believe you. [SPEAKER_02] Mitch, what were you? I was a seer and I can verify one of their stories. I was the seer. [SPEAKER_02] You are? No. No. [SPEAKER_02] That was just no. [SPEAKER_02] So Justin's trying to find his way out at this point. [SPEAKER_02] You guys can vote for me. I can verify. I can verify. Who can you verify? I looked at cards in the middle. [SPEAKER_01] I can verify Elbow's story. Who can verify? [SPEAKER_01] So how can you verify one person's? I can't verify anyone's story. You said you could verify one person's. No, you did. No, I didn't. You did? Did he not say it? No, I said I- [SPEAKER_02] I said I want to hear anyone else before I start talking but then when we did this Mitchell said he verified Elvin's story. I don't I don't remember Justin saying that I don't think it's okay Maybe it is here just bump this kiss this kiss [SPEAKER_01] I don't, I don't remember. [SPEAKER_00] I don't remember. [SPEAKER_01] Oh, okay, maybe it is here. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] If you drive up in view that wall... [SPEAKER_00] So much, you're with us, Slayer. What did you- [SPEAKER_02] So Mitch, if you were this clear, what did you see? I saw Elbent's card, that's the one I can see. You saw a village. The safest card to see. Yes. And that's why I was like, I'm just gonna hold back here and wait a little bit. And what did you see in the middle? I saw a werewolf and a drunk. [SPEAKER_01] What did you see? I saw it. [SPEAKER_01] You saw my- [SPEAKER_00] of military. [SPEAKER_01] And what did you see in the middle? [SPEAKER_02] Show me. [SPEAKER_01] Show me. [SPEAKER_02] So one of those, we all think that one of those were sitting there. [SPEAKER_02] We all think that one of those was residing there? [SPEAKER_01] I would just incoherent. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] I think Justin is grappling for away and he's throwing me under the bus right now. I think Justin's the where we'll furniture the Tanner. [SPEAKER_01] I went just to throw away out of it and he's throwing me under the bus right now. [SPEAKER_01] Uh-huh. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] You know what I'm saying? One of us is really going to be the Tanner. Yeah. I was like, oh man, the Tanner would be great. [SPEAKER_01] One of us is really going to be the... [SPEAKER_00] Yeah [SPEAKER_02] No. [SPEAKER_01] will [SPEAKER_01] This is a game to you. This is how it is. I am so confident. Oh my god. You are about to lose us the game again No matter what anyone says my boat is Mitchell [SPEAKER_02] I'm so confident in this. Oh my god, man, you are about to lose us. [SPEAKER_02] Uncle,a\u786c! peep [SPEAKER_02] I think just I still stand by Justin where I will miss Tanner. Can I know why? What's it? Can I know why me and I will miss you. Justin is throwing me under the butts right now and you are being a fucking sander with me. [SPEAKER_01] kind of why [SPEAKER_01] Yes? [SPEAKER_01] I'll just take it to center group and work that. [SPEAKER_02] At the Tanner don't want to be hung right yeah, and he's been no one. Oh, he's been he's playing With you on this 100 there is a he gave no information and claiming the the seer is because he had no information He was the goddamn werewolf got this information right here [SPEAKER_01] At the time I'm home, I wanna be home. [SPEAKER_01] You're gonna pay a penny out of this, okay. How'd you get out of the box, am I gonna join you. Campus x hijo,\u0631\u0628 [SPEAKER_01] you don't fucking kill a damn dog ? [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] You also couldn't look at one of those and you were the wearable. [SPEAKER_02] It's true. It's true. Maybe he saw the other werewolf. Maybe. Actually, even if he saw it, he would be the... James and I know, get in the house. [SPEAKER_00] It's true. [SPEAKER_01] So, in the video, give an ad like the same. [SPEAKER_02] I believe both of you. Well, yeah, what... Yeah. You've everybody's very... I know you're telling the truth. [SPEAKER_01] You provide history. I know. [SPEAKER_01] Unless James is like just I'm not listening to it. I hesitated last time and I fucked the game up I guarantee you that when we change cards, this is what you are saying [SPEAKER_02] I honestly think what's happening is we have no werewolf and Mitch is the Tanner. Okay, what if Justin could be the Tanner by claiming the same role someone else has is a great way of getting So it's very true. [SPEAKER_01] It's very true. We can still win if we just say that. [SPEAKER_02] both the werewolves and then he turns out to be the 10. Aw, he made that to be the 9th. No, I don't care. [SPEAKER_01] I guarantee you Alvin, I guarantee you this is how it stands. I'm that confident. It's good. [SPEAKER_01] I think one of them is a ten. [SPEAKER_02] So if I was a seer and he was a Tanner, that would be a great opportunity to say, after I said I'm a seer, he goes, oh wait, I'm a seer and then there's suspicion. So that could be an attempt to be a tour. Why is it my first? In all fairness, a seer is also a good one when someone has already claimed something to verify someone else's story. If in that I did earlier, and got me a lot of heat. If I was a werewolf, that means that I claimed seer before I heard whatever one else said. That means I would you... I heard what we both said. Yeah, and he used me to verify. Whatever it is. [SPEAKER_01] I said mine first. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_01] when you heard about we will said [SPEAKER_01] Whatever it is they're not both werewolves because they're fighting so I guarantee you it's Mitchell as a werewolf and Just I don't know the fuck Justin We got a boat right away for Justin I think wow [SPEAKER_02] I still feel like it's okay. So we're talking about what Ethan Kears left. That fits with that. So I think we're going to vote for one. All right, we got a vote right away. For Justin, I think. Wow. It's Justin and he made it to be a sucker for it. It's Michel."}

[SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] You might not be who you thought who you think you are. [SPEAKER_01] So does anyone want to declare anything? [SPEAKER_01] Oh wait, just someone else first. I'm gonna say, I was the robber. [SPEAKER_00] but I could tape that from here, right? I was the seer. [SPEAKER_01] here. [SPEAKER_01] I know one person with their card was. [SPEAKER_01] So do not lie to me. But I could have been switched. Well, I played my serial role. [SPEAKER_00] Thank you, Edvin. [SPEAKER_01] So I did look at a car. Okay, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. [SPEAKER_00] Baab missionary. [SPEAKER_01] Damn did you switch anyone's cards around? Yes, here we do switch. [SPEAKER_00] Yes, here we go. [SPEAKER_01] Maybe wait till my turn. Yeah, I'm not getting it. What are you? [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I'm like, what are you? [SPEAKER_01] a villager. So we got villager, villager, sear, trouble maker, drawvers, so we currently have no werewolves. It is possible to have no werewolves. [SPEAKER_01] Dan. [SPEAKER_01] Who did you switch around? [SPEAKER_00] Who's card did you take? [SPEAKER_01] I took the logic of trying to not just to stay on the side of the village, as we said, so I did not switch with anybody. I am still the robber. [SPEAKER_01] It's possible he switched with someone looked at the card and it turns out to be a war wolf and now he's trying to play it. It's possible. Can I know who you guys like who you swatch with or who you looked at? I just say the person I looked at is being honest right now. [SPEAKER_02] It's mass I \u00e4ndern [SPEAKER_00] Can I do it? [SPEAKER_00] \u0441\u0435\u0440.. [SPEAKER_01] Let's start with that. Okay, let's try it. [SPEAKER_00] with that. Okay that's fair. Okay. Okay. I switched, Kaitlyn and Justin. [SPEAKER_01] No why? [SPEAKER_00] No lies. All right, Kiela is a werewolf. I think that she is a werewolf. No! [SPEAKER_01] No, came out the way where we're piled the way where we're [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] But to be fair, Caitlin put villager and she could be villager, but I think that she was a werewolf and she didn't know what else to take. So she took a villager. No, no, no, no. [SPEAKER_01] No, no, no, no, you switch with me you switch stars. Yeah, yeah, no, I was aware of it [SPEAKER_00] He's not saying he's a while he said he's a werewolf and switched with Caitlin. Yeah, but I'm saying [SPEAKER_01] Gun! [SPEAKER_01] No, no, I can guarantee there was only one werewolf. It was me. If you switch with Kaylon, she's the werewolf. There's not two werewolves. There is, boy! There is! [SPEAKER_00] There is boy here. That's what I'm saying is I think you're the other wearable. Well there was [SPEAKER_01] there was I'm the I with the werewolf at the start. [SPEAKER_00] He gets to know what all the other I will open my eyes. Oh, okay. [SPEAKER_01] I was the only one, saw Robert. [SPEAKER_01] and if you switch dust, K-1 is aware of it. [SPEAKER_01] Who'd you look at? [SPEAKER_01] I don't even know. So what you're saying is true as the side of the village. [SPEAKER_01] She's the werewolf. Cause I was the werewolf at the beginning. Now is there any way Justin is messing with us? Yes. I don't know. [SPEAKER_00] Yes, I think that they're both werewolves and he's trying to save his ass [SPEAKER_01] He's just trying to save his ass. But if he threw her under the bus and she is a werewolf right now and she gets voted, both werewolves loose. Yes. So they need the werewolves. Yeah. Do you need to work together? Oh, that's true. They win or lose as a team. Okay. The troublemaker happens after the robber. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] they would say winner loose [SPEAKER_01] but there is no right. There was no right. Exactly. So it's her. She's the werewolf. If what you're saying is true, then yes. That totally makes sense. I'm just trying to see if there's a loophole that you're like, so I just. [SPEAKER_00] Exactly. [SPEAKER_00] So, I just... Exploded? What happens if there's two werewolves, we just have to vote out one in the win? Yes. Oh, yeah. And if there's... [SPEAKER_01] Yes, oh yeah, and if there's nowhere walls we have to be careful to not vote anyone out So if we think there's nowhere walls we just get a tie and then no one [SPEAKER_00] So [SPEAKER_00] Unless he's... [SPEAKER_00] He saw her card. [SPEAKER_00] with what? [SPEAKER_00] with his something else and [SPEAKER_00] Maybe he was a ropper. Maybe he- [SPEAKER_01] look at her. He switched with her. He ended up with the werewolf. [SPEAKER_02] One minute. [SPEAKER_01] That's true. No guys. Why not? He is a world he knows. [SPEAKER_00] No, guys. [SPEAKER_00] Huh ... So now ... [SPEAKER_00] But he said that you said you picked up a card here. I love this card. Why would I why would I lie at the beginning and you have to take the card? [SPEAKER_01] I loved it this card. Why would I why would I lie at the beginning and you have to take the card? No, you just look at it. No, no, no, as the rover you can only change with players as the only werewolf I looked here Saw rover. [SPEAKER_02] No, you just look at it. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, you know what?

[SPEAKER_01] It's not brave. It's brave because it looks suspicious. I can confirm that one of these three stories are true.

[SPEAKER_02] Yes, are you sure? Yes, okay. [SPEAKER_03] I didn't switch anybody. Who did you switch? I switched these two. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Okay. Now, out of the three of us, myself included, we could have been aware Wolf looked at a card, saw a villager, and claimed, I can... [SPEAKER_01] I can confirm that one of these two is a villager. [SPEAKER_03] and probably still a villager. [SPEAKER_02] Can anyone verify a trouble maker? [SPEAKER_00] So are you a villager now then? Yes. Okay. So Caitlin and Justin, like Justin confirmed that Caitlin was the villager. I think... I can find out one of these two. [SPEAKER_01] Malstra [SPEAKER_03] Yeah. Oh, he's sweet, so it's not stare. It's robber. [SPEAKER_03] and he switched with one of you too. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, and what you're saying? Okay. [SPEAKER_02] There was hesitation in that voice. Oh, just because I was like, the next... [SPEAKER_01] Well, just because I was like, did I confirm that? But yes, I did because I said I am now a villager. I did, yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] I did because I said I now. [SPEAKER_00] And you switched us like you are switched these two and you are villager. I started as a villager Okay, I was actually the seer and Mike is a werewolf [SPEAKER_01] alright I wish [SPEAKER_03] these two. [SPEAKER_02] Okay, so here we are. That's a big, either of them can be a wormless in replaying this position like they're in there. That was late coming to the game on that. [SPEAKER_03] That's a big work. Either of them can be a world with a replay. [SPEAKER_03] That was late coming to the game on that. [SPEAKER_02] But I'll buy it. The look on his face. I'm only a little further. So Mike, defend yourself now. [SPEAKER_03] I've already defended myself. I've switched these two. [SPEAKER_00] Mike's the werewolf. Ha ha ha. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] Man. [SPEAKER_01] If what you read it [SPEAKER_03] if what you but it's he but I but here's what I'm getting from he was waiting for Justin to not say he was the seer I got my troublemaker from the beginning [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] I was waiting to see [SPEAKER_01] I want to be something about Dan. Dan played, he was a snake in the grass. He was a good snake. You're good. You waited to see everyone else's story. I was trying to... [SPEAKER_00] He was a good second. You're good. You waited to see everyone else's story. I was trying to see if you were in fact the trouble maker just to prove so I'd have you being the robber and you being the trouble maker on my boat that he is the werewolf and he's not the trouble maker. He's lying. [SPEAKER_02] If you lied to me, I'm gonna be really mad. Damn, did- [SPEAKER_01] He claimed that you took my card because he knew he wasn't a villager. [SPEAKER_00] That's why I did that. That's true. Oh, that's true. [SPEAKER_01] Yes, that's true. [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_01] That's also why I paused there because I was like yeah, I'm good to go to a vote. Yeah, Mitch, my girl.

[SPEAKER_01] that someone, one of you for, is claiming to have the position I was. [SPEAKER_01] I'm dying. [SPEAKER_01] Robert? [SPEAKER_01] No, no, I'm saying I'm one of these four.

Oh, so you still are one of those you Yes, I believe I was lying [SPEAKER_01] No, I started with the position line. [SPEAKER_01] Yes, I believe I am who's why these people I don't want to give that up yet. I want the liar to [SPEAKER_02] Otherwise, not gonna come forward, no, but I want, we gotta figure it out. [SPEAKER_02] Justin, who'd you look at? I looked at your cards in the center. No, it was too big. So, yeah. And they were too village. [SPEAKER_03] No, it was the center. Okay, there were two villagers. Okay, then, which is suspicious. Okay, this is what I think happened then. Mitch was the seer. [SPEAKER_03] Justin was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_02] Nope, I was this year from the beginning. I looked at two guys on the side of this. There was two villagers. I promise you that. No, I've got it. [SPEAKER_03] I promise you that I did do this for you. No, I did. [SPEAKER_03] Justin was the werewolf and I'm gonna fuck things up. I switched these two. [SPEAKER_02] Oh, Justin's the werewolf! That's not possible. Did you start as a werewolf? Yeah! [SPEAKER_02] Justin's the where we're all! [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_03] So if it wasn't before he is now. [SPEAKER_01] He is now! [SPEAKER_02] Let's hope you know someone's lying. [SPEAKER_03] What if there's two, there's two werewolves? What if there's two werewolves? And it's Mitch and Justin. [SPEAKER_02] But if there's two... [SPEAKER_01] Justin's the werewolf. So Justin's... [SPEAKER_03] So Justin's still saying he was a seer. At the beginning I was. So then... [SPEAKER_03] I definitely switch these two. [SPEAKER_02] What is the order of everything? It goes, Where wills, Seer, Robert, Trullmaker? [SPEAKER_03] I'm going to speed order of everything. [SPEAKER_01] Everything. [SPEAKER_01] Just a huge look at. [SPEAKER_02] I learned to do it in the center. [SPEAKER_01] Why do I keep asking you that question? [SPEAKER_02] and they were like this. [SPEAKER_02] Let's see it again. [SPEAKER_01] Okay. [SPEAKER_02] Do this, oh, the order? Yeah, oh, okay. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Please wait a minute. It can't be funny. Alright. Please wait a second. They're still supportive of me! Have fun! [SPEAKER_03] There it is. [SPEAKER_02] Where are all, where are all, seer, robber, trouble maker. [SPEAKER_02] Mitch. [SPEAKER_03] Mitch, what were you? [SPEAKER_02] Can you confirm my story? [SPEAKER_01] Old [SPEAKER_01] I was lying about someone taking my position. Great! [SPEAKER_01] Great! [SPEAKER_03] So you are wearable? [SPEAKER_03] I fu- fire I think it's you too, I did. You're almost. [SPEAKER_02] What if Mitch stole from me? [SPEAKER_02] and now he's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_03] He was the robber and you're saying, you're the robber. [SPEAKER_02] And you're saying, you're the Robert. And he's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_03] No but, I swear to Robert, Robert went first. That's true. That's true. You're still the werewolf. That's technically a set of bad news. [SPEAKER_02] I so it goes Robert We're all just okay, bye Way to goin Per\u00f2ber [SPEAKER_02] That's technically yes that would be how it goes. But I, I, that confirms Caitlin saying a villager earlier because that was a lie. And if she's open about being aware of what happened now. 30 seconds. I was the robber. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Hold it to yourself from. [SPEAKER_01] I still from there. [SPEAKER_02] So now you're the town. [SPEAKER_01] Maybe. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Yes. We're still so wearable. [SPEAKER_01] Well, I can... Can I confirm something? No. I looked at that. [SPEAKER_01] Just in the middle! [SPEAKER_02] Okay, you look at that. That's what you're being honest. [SPEAKER_01] \u30b9\u30c3\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u30a4\u30f3\u30b0 [SPEAKER_02] Damn, wasn't being honest. [SPEAKER_02] En fin!"}

I was like, you guys grabbed each other's color. We may have. Yeah, but I would just skip that step. Was anyone really memorizing the way they put their card down? No. No. My eye. [SPEAKER_03] No, no, I can't just watch a couple games. Maybe just... [SPEAKER_02] I was for a couple games. Maybe just just just barely and then take your hands away Like just what are you just like little bit and just touch your card? [SPEAKER_03] What are you just like little bit and just touch your card? Yeah, don't move it because when you open your eyes you can confirm if you touch the right card [SPEAKER_01] Can you just like little bit and just...

[SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_03] Okay, first, can I just say something rid of that? I accidentally opened my eyes during one of the phases. I'm not saying which. Um, and I didn't see, and I didn't see like, I don't know, I can't tell you something without giving it away. But, um, did anyone else open their eyes? [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. Um, and I didn't, and I didn't. [SPEAKER_03] Nobody saw me, it's like a whole new role then. I was just positive, I was just positive this because it's not a game. No, I'm not answering your question because it might give away something. No, no, no. I'm just gonna say, I'd rather not restart the game because that's the only thing. But if I just not say anything about what I saw and pretend I didn't see anything, can we just continue? [SPEAKER_01] I'm just pausing this, cause it's not a good one. [SPEAKER_01] One, two, one. None of this- [SPEAKER_00] I'm gonna say. [SPEAKER_00] Willy, but [SPEAKER_02] Can you use it? [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah. What is it, what is it? What is it? I think it should be public knowledge now, which round? [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] was it and yeah wasn't the werewolf [SPEAKER_01] Seriously? We're not playing the game. It was not the werewolf. Then I think that's what matters most. The werewolf is the hardest. What position was it? Which one was it? You want to know what you want to learn? [SPEAKER_03] Seriously? Yeah, we're not playing the game. It was not the werewolf. Then I think that's what matters most. The werewolf. [SPEAKER_03] Do you want to know what you have? [SPEAKER_02] Well, if you don't remember. [SPEAKER_01] Well, if you don't remember, see you robber to trouble maker. [SPEAKER_03] Oh, it was Trouble Maker. Okay. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, come on. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_01] Alright, let's keep going, okay? [SPEAKER_01] What did you do? Who did you switch? [SPEAKER_02] Let's wait. All right, that's fair. Everybody else gets to play this game. Oh [SPEAKER_01] Alright, that's fair. [SPEAKER_03] Just so you know, I don't know what you did. Who'd you like to see? I just saw you like moving. I was like, oh fuck, what did you see? I just opened up my eyes. I saw. [SPEAKER_01] What you did who did you like saw you like move? I was like oh fuck what did I see my eyes? I saw two villagers two villagers [SPEAKER_02] That's far in Mike's, I have to slide over Mike's flip-team step to do what I can do. So that means that there has to be a werewolf in play. Yep. If you're speaking the truth. Or, Justin's a werewolf and he saw a seer. Nope, because it's pretty bold to say there's two villagers there. [SPEAKER_01] So just let me move. That means... [SPEAKER_01] a war [SPEAKER_01] Not at all. Cause there are two villagers there. No, if you're a werewolf, then I'm not, it would be bull. But so I'm saying. [SPEAKER_02] No, if you're a werewolf, then I'm not it would be both, but so I'm saying you're not a werewolf. You're probably a seer Besides probably eyes [SPEAKER_03] that's probably true, except for the fact that I was actually this year, and this is a villager, and this is a robber. [SPEAKER_02] Okay, so why would Justin lie he could be a werewolf [SPEAKER_03] or downs the tenor. [SPEAKER_01] What are you guys guys? Just... [SPEAKER_02] What are you guys? You guys talk. Justin claims seer first move. [SPEAKER_03] Let's have a nice climb today. [SPEAKER_01] But what's the negative strategy, Mike? Tell me the order again. Seer, Robert Troublemaker. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_03] My Columbia. [SPEAKER_03] Robert didn't go. Like, I can tell you that if she is the troublemaker and I'm a seer, that's the only stuff that happened there. Oh yeah. So the rest are werewolves. Like, this is villager, this is Robert, for sure. 100%. [SPEAKER_01] Oh yeah. [SPEAKER_02] So practiced early ... [SPEAKER_00] where will. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] Like this is- [SPEAKER_02] I suspect we have a Tanner. [SPEAKER_02] You know? Ooh, that's a bold move. Could be, that was a good strategy. He took the strategy that Mike said to do as a tanner. Claims here right off the bat. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_03] Oh, that's a ball move. Could be, that was a good shot. He took... [SPEAKER_01] Or is the wherewolf I saw a seer in here? Or a wherewolf? And then I was like two villagers. The only Tanner would think they made me a wherewolf. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_03] The only tenor would think they were all there was. But no, they're... oh yeah, I guess so. [SPEAKER_02] But no V [SPEAKER_02] But you wouldn't see a seer dancing on the truth. [SPEAKER_01] Damn, it's not telling me the truth. Damn's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_03] I-no, I am telling the truth.

[SPEAKER_01] Great. Let's try. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] goose then, okay? [SPEAKER_02] You switched those two. Maybe it's Mike.

[SPEAKER_01] I was a Tanner and I think Justin Stolf and Rainy doesn't want to admit it. [SPEAKER_02] I can agree with that. Hmm. That means Katelyn's a werewolf. Then let's try to find who the werewolf is. That means Katelyn's a werewolf. Okay. [SPEAKER_01] Let me see what the electronic sound impacts some sounds And the sound effects [SPEAKER_00] then let's try to find you the wherewith is that [SPEAKER_02] We don't know what this one is, but it's obviously, if we're all telling this correctly, then those are the two werewolves and Caitlyn's a werewolf.

[SPEAKER_00] And that's where are you? [SPEAKER_00] Are you the drunk? [SPEAKER_01] I think Justin is a liar and I think Justin is who we need to vote for. [SPEAKER_02] It's true.

[SPEAKER_01] You can say it, it's switching with a lot of people. [SPEAKER_02] I think I'm warning. I agree with that because Mitch hadn't said anything that he done, that he done. And Justin said that one of us has a time to prove. There's two where it was out there. It doesn't matter which one of those two is the where it was. Katelyn's the where it was. Katelyn is not gonna.

[SPEAKER_03] So I'm either the Tanner or the drunk. [SPEAKER_02] Then we need to know something, you're on our team. [SPEAKER_01] But you're on our team, so I don't think you're the tenors. [SPEAKER_03] If he's a drunk, he's a liability, and if he's a Tanner, he's a liability in the opposite way. We can't vote for him, but if he's drunk, then... [SPEAKER_03] I probably do want to vote for it. Guys, we have a minute and fifty seconds. It's possible they were both werewolves. [SPEAKER_02] Guys. [SPEAKER_02] It's possible, they were- [SPEAKER_03] And they're just like, we're villagers. [SPEAKER_02] Then we need you, we have a minute and 45 seconds. Okay. [SPEAKER_01] I was the seer. [SPEAKER_02] Did you look at people's cards or to do it in the center? [SPEAKER_01] I looked in the center. What did you see? [SPEAKER_02] What did you see?

[SPEAKER_02] No, that was the Tanner. [SPEAKER_02] Now I feel like I'm fucked because I'm gonna vote for me. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Who do you say to it? But you are the robber. [SPEAKER_03] But you are the robber. I am the robber. I [SPEAKER_03] Holy fuck, it's 50 seconds. Yeah. Anyone could be a werewolf at this table. I don't trust anyone. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_03] If the villains by best get places were all innocent and we're also doing really well if the if the if we told if we vote [SPEAKER_01] V7 why be it... [SPEAKER_01] If we vote somebody out from the village, do we lose? [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] There's a wear wolf, yes. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_00] 30 seconds. Close your doors. [SPEAKER_03] So if Dan was telling the truth we're all good if Dan's lying he's a werewolf so it's all on Dan's shoulders So that's all vote for Dan. No, but if he's good then we all lose if he's telling the truth No, no, we don't lose if only if there was werewolf [SPEAKER_00] Oh, damn sure. [SPEAKER_01] so this is all going for Dan. [SPEAKER_01] I don't know, we don't lose [SPEAKER_02] Only if there was were wolves. No, if we kill, if we kill an innocent, we'll out the world. Yes, but no, but what? [SPEAKER_01] But no, but what if there was no wearables? [SPEAKER_02] I believe we lose. Yeah. Only if it's a splotet. [SPEAKER_03] I [SPEAKER_01] I don't think Justin was the drunk. [SPEAKER_03] I think Justin... [SPEAKER_03] I trust, I trust Dan and I think we're all good, that's my opinion. [SPEAKER_01] He wouldn't put the Tanner down. I was not there. No, you can't talk to me. [SPEAKER_02] How did we know we can't talk to you?"}

Why does it matter right now because I don't want to give all the information I don't know because that's your werewolf or a tower and you casting suspicious [SPEAKER_01] No, no, no, no, tell us what you stole. [SPEAKER_01] Why does it matter right now? [SPEAKER_01] I don't want to give all of my information out of them. Because that means you're... [SPEAKER_01] I think James is the Mason. I'm definitely just a go. What? [SPEAKER_00] was no guarantees once [SPEAKER_00] Started a life-born could wake up a werewolf, who knows. [SPEAKER_01] Mike, on a scale of 1 to 10, how exciting is the character that you stole? Not very exciting. [SPEAKER_01] Like, villager not very exciting? Like, villager not very exciting. You liar. No, I'm not lying. [SPEAKER_00] It's not lying. [SPEAKER_01] What are you? What are you? I was not a villager. What if we each hit the same time? Three? No! No! No! No! Almost got my ill. It's got me. [SPEAKER_00] out of illusory. [SPEAKER_00] No, no, no. [SPEAKER_01] So we just had it in past day. [SPEAKER_01] But if I said I was one of these three. [SPEAKER_01] with 3 or you possibly. [SPEAKER_01] The rule is one of them has to be true. [SPEAKER_01] no another [SPEAKER_01] I was one of these three. And one of them is true. Yeah, because one of mine was true. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] What's our name? Patrick literally wants us to be shooting you. So how do we eat that? [SPEAKER_01] now now? [SPEAKER_01] So how do we... [SPEAKER_01] How do you determine? So, and I determine that we both know this is the one we're sharing. Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] So [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I mean, real, I don't think you're the talent. [SPEAKER_01] I was the Tanner. [SPEAKER_01] and makes which with me. [SPEAKER_01] I did not know I switched good games. And I think he is... [SPEAKER_01] which has a dense wish in it. [SPEAKER_01] This is the truth for what this can assure back us up. [SPEAKER_01] See you. That was one of these two. [SPEAKER_00] I'm just going to vote in John. [SPEAKER_01] What were you when you went to sleep? [SPEAKER_01] I was about to use two on him at the sleep. When you're in a room, you woke up. I don't know. [SPEAKER_00] Everyone. [SPEAKER_01] or do that. [SPEAKER_01] So we got a werewolf, we got a Tanner, we have a rover and a villager. This is not looking like a good night for you. Why? What if they're both werewolf? [SPEAKER_00] Finally bought the Bible! [SPEAKER_01] Because you guys are corroborating, corroborating, corroborating each other's stories. [SPEAKER_01] No, Jameson believed me from the beginning. [SPEAKER_00] I think he's the Tanner. It's trying to cast a special. So I was, give guys a minute. I don't see how he meets- I don't see how he meets- [SPEAKER_01] I don't see how me switching with a village or cash transmission on myself. [SPEAKER_00] Everyone switches with the village. Everyone wants the life where you just you fucking just get by you do you put in your eight you get by comfortably What if we don't have werewolves? What if we don't have werewolves? [SPEAKER_01] What if we don't have werewolves? [SPEAKER_01] What if I was this? [SPEAKER_01] Where you yourself and you woke up? [SPEAKER_01] I can confirm I was myself when I woke up, I still feel like Justin. [SPEAKER_01] I'll vote to the left. [SPEAKER_00] No. [SPEAKER_00] Because there's a world about things, nature. I also suspect... [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I also suspect there's a worm up out there. Pretty... [SPEAKER_00] Who do you suspect? It's natural. [SPEAKER_01] from me. [SPEAKER_00] Let's measure. [SPEAKER_01] I think it's Mike. [SPEAKER_00] I'm getting too much on. I might not cause a robber a lot. [SPEAKER_01] Only your making step feather additions becomesright cause you are holding your eye out. [SPEAKER_01] So you're seeing it's Mike? No. [SPEAKER_00] rove revenue, [SPEAKER_00] I understand that giggling something out here. I don't see why anybody's story reminds me. [SPEAKER_01] Bye.

This is back to Mitchell or Mike. Can I know why? Because Mike just, I don't... [SPEAKER_01] Why? [SPEAKER_01] Problem is I haven't heard either of them try to outmode like manipulate us with a word of heaven. [SPEAKER_00] We're heaven. [SPEAKER_00] But I think also you're talking so I kind of think you might be aware of who. [SPEAKER_01] but I think I also... [SPEAKER_01] and then you're on something, James. [SPEAKER_00] Well, now you're agreeing with me and I always make some suspicious because you manipulate me. You know, one of my guys, I'm voting Mike. [SPEAKER_00] only 30 seconds left. Thanks, pal. I mean, Rich is maybe trying to push people away from voting for him. [SPEAKER_00] Bipes to showing he's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, you don't want to be going down and it blazes glorious, which way there's no where-als. You want to start making suspicions, so why are you not talking like the Tanner? [SPEAKER_01] in all fairness. [SPEAKER_01] My fairness. I'm just saying, I'm part of the village team. I just don't want- In all fairness, you know, why are you not- [SPEAKER_01] most"}

[SPEAKER_00] You started as a mirror. I started as a wearable. [SPEAKER_01] word will. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_02] I think he's the tenor. [SPEAKER_00] Well, you actually robbed before me. [SPEAKER_00] So I feel like you should tell me who you robbed first. [SPEAKER_01] No, I need I wanna know who you're talking Cause [SPEAKER_00] No, no, I'm not you were before me. You can't make up any sort of bullshit. I'm not making it in James Can you tell us now what you work when you woke up? No [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, they make up any sort of bullshit. I'm not making any jokes. [SPEAKER_00] okay i don't want to i think he's now the where we're at i think you're [SPEAKER_01] I don't want to. I think he's now the wherewolf. Ha ha ha ha. I think you switched us to. I'm pretty coveted, I'm the longer wherewolf. You switched us to. So you were wherewolf. Can I just ask, did you ride the ice-surdiness of wherewolf? That's a bold statement. I did not ride the ice-surdiness of wherewolf.

[SPEAKER_01] I want a vote for you, not me. So you're actually where the world is going to be? I started as the world. [SPEAKER_00] So you were actually where the world started as the world? I don't blame for Saginais suspicious. [SPEAKER_00] That's the least suspicious thing. And you stole from him. No, I stole from you. You stole from me. Can you back up my story? Yes. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] You'll love a chat. [SPEAKER_01] That he's a troublemaker? Yes. So right now, look at it. That doesn't really matter. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah [SPEAKER_00] And what were you at the beginning, Mitchell? I was a little afraid. I was a little afraid. So now, be here at the Insomniac. So does this story check out for everybody? No. [SPEAKER_01] I was a little afraid. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] So James would know. [SPEAKER_01] But, okay, but Justin Swift. Okay, I really trust this story up until the point of that I was not a werewolf. I was a Tanner. You were? I was. I was a Tanner. So I thought so. And now I'm starting to back away from saying werewolf because now we're starting to put this mission on him. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_00] and now I'm on... [SPEAKER_00] Sov road \u05e0 quand mow morning [SPEAKER_02] One minute remaining. [SPEAKER_00] Waiting. Where were you at the start things on me? Yeah. And you're the Tanner now. I don't want to say. Should we just go to our left? Because if we go to our left, James loses. Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_00] Unless the open is melt and you know. [SPEAKER_01] Unless he wants to vote for whoever, but left it still Mitchell. Nobody, someone else- [SPEAKER_00] No, but if someone else is hung he loses It needs to be someone else's hung like if another villager is hung you lose if you're the Tanner you only for you [SPEAKER_01] It needs to be someone else's home. [SPEAKER_02] Thank you so much for watching. Thank you. [SPEAKER_01] another [SPEAKER_01] You'll only for you to win if your a Tanner is to die. [SPEAKER_00] If you're a Tanner. [SPEAKER_00] I just uh... [SPEAKER_01] I'm just... [SPEAKER_02] only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_00] This is bullshit and I am the werewolf so... [SPEAKER_00] I think I'll take the chance on us losing the new winner. [SPEAKER_01] Oh man, okay, I don't think it's mutuals the feelings right? [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Because I don't think if Mitchell's the village, I think he would, he would lie about you being a werewolf. Because... It could be double werewolf. To the left? It could be double werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] Peace. [SPEAKER_01] So both of them would be well, just in. That's as possible already. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] But then everyone"}

[SPEAKER_00] bus [SPEAKER_00] get away oh no [SPEAKER_04] I don't know why the confusion is coming from. [SPEAKER_03] I think the confusion is coming from you. I just kind of think of what I need to, what I want to give out there. [SPEAKER_00] Can I parlay what I think? Which one of you was actually the trouble now? I will. [SPEAKER_06] I was okay [SPEAKER_06] I was, I was, I was one of... [SPEAKER_05] the Tanner. Yes, that's exactly what's happening. Did you have the Tanner? I had the Tanner at one point. And how you dealt. [SPEAKER_01] I don't know. I do not think I do. [SPEAKER_01] One of them is the other. And one of them is the other. Now the other. What did you switch? [SPEAKER_06] What did you switch? [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_04] One of them was the Insami Act and then looked and they're now the Tanner. [SPEAKER_00] Just do it for me, and then we switch it back. [SPEAKER_04] There's a Tanner out there, Mike. There's a Tanner out there. And that Tanner is trying to also pretend to be the trouble maker. So the question is, which one of these is the Tanner? So we have no werewolves that... [SPEAKER_00] There's a tenor out there [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_00] So we have no wearables that we're saying. We're gonna just let it like do. [SPEAKER_02] We're gonna just like do not believe there's a werewolf out there [SPEAKER_06] We're gonna\u4ee5\u524d make\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f a lot, but I date a bunch of fellow [SPEAKER_00] Why would you hold that information back though if you were the seer? [SPEAKER_01] I was seeing if someone was gonna lie. But that's a thing, but no one would. [SPEAKER_04] But I still think that no one would because the werewolves are gone. Well, I wanted to see if someone was going to be the Tanner and say on the werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] Woo! [SPEAKER_02] Now he could might be a werewolf and he looked at one and he saw a werewolf and now he's just saying whatever he saw this year. I just hate the place. [SPEAKER_00] I just hate the place where someone like us here with that information would hide that information I want to know if there was a Tanner out there, but then you know I'm yeah, I'm I'm actually where it happens naturally when that happens when you say as a villager I see two werewolves then the Tanner's like, you know, right? [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_01] I don't know if there was a... [SPEAKER_01] You know, I'm, yeah, I'm especially that. [SPEAKER_01] of natural [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_00] I just, I don't like that. So what's- [SPEAKER_02] So what's possible is he was a werewolf and he saw a seer and now he's saying the reverse. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I just don't trust like a villager to not know [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_03] No one could back did anyone switch his whoever was the actually both of you answer your both Please tell me or did either of you switch it? [SPEAKER_06] I did not swap YouTube [SPEAKER_03] okay [SPEAKER_00] Yeah [SPEAKER_03] He's your puppet, Anne! [SPEAKER_05] Fuck it, Tanner! You motherfuckers! [SPEAKER_01] and then I O\u0435\u043b\u0430 to see you off p\u307e\u3067 [SPEAKER_06] I hate that you're lying to my face and everybody else. [SPEAKER_00] I hate it. I just think you're coming a bit. No, it was so mad right now. [SPEAKER_01] Oh, come on. Don't! Just don't! [SPEAKER_04] Okay, so there is a [SPEAKER_05] Okay, so there is a tanner on the board. We must not vote for him. Now the real question is, he is seer or a werewolf. [SPEAKER_06] You're trying to make me think you're... No. Fuck you, I'm a troll maker. I'm like... Fuck you! [SPEAKER_00] Mike's like you on a troll I agree Mike's a world like you're making something [SPEAKER_01] You're making something stop the timer [SPEAKER_01] Oh my God! [SPEAKER_02] I don't know what I'm voting for. [SPEAKER_06] Were you the Tanner to start? Yes, it's already minutes later. So, Justin's the fucking Tanner. [SPEAKER_01] Alright, it's been 30 minutes, folks. So... [SPEAKER_06] and Mike is the werewolf. [SPEAKER_00] And it makes the world. [SPEAKER_07] One minute remaining. [SPEAKER_06] Are you fuckers both werewolves? No I'm a troll maker. You guarantee me you saw two werewolves and there's no possibility these two fuckers could be werewolves. No I'm guaranteeing so. [SPEAKER_00] Now I'm a troll maker. [SPEAKER_05] No, I'm guaranteed I saw two levels. Mike's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_06] Yeah, I just don't like cuz then he can see to where we'll see or [SPEAKER_04] Or he's a seren we should not be voting for him. [SPEAKER_00] You know? But I will probably fall in that blade, ball of knife with... [SPEAKER_05]  [SPEAKER_05] I would air on the side of it being a werewolf. [SPEAKER_02] Because just as losing either way because the tenor suite is very important. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_06] The third gear. Both were only 30 seconds left. No, it doesn't add up, it doesn't add up. [SPEAKER_06] Wait, there's two werewolves and one... [SPEAKER_00] Hey, why don't we all just go either on [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_05] I'm the only way I will have armed the seer. [SPEAKER_00] I would ever have started this robber. Who'd you steal from? [SPEAKER_04] I'm given my- I'm given my- [SPEAKER_05] to [SPEAKER_02] universal Robert. [SPEAKER_02] I stole from Justin. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] And you switch us too. [SPEAKER_06] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] So that means I'm in the Tanner. [SPEAKER_06] No time is up. No, it is time is up. [SPEAKER_00] No, it gets time's up. [SPEAKER_07] Three"}

[SPEAKER_01] Does everyone get a say anything? Was there a trouble maker out there? [SPEAKER_01] Was there a werewolf out there? [SPEAKER_00] I was troublemaker. [SPEAKER_00] and I switched my congested. [SPEAKER_01] Anyone confirmed this? [SPEAKER_00] Is that yours? This is you? Oh, it's me! [SPEAKER_01] This is you That's me No, it's Justin. No, it's the first time. It's me. You're touching me right now. Yeah, it's me right now How is this possibly you? Because I've got my feet all the way over there. I know. I was like [SPEAKER_00] You're touching me right now. Yeah, I'm just hearing. I was like, ha! [SPEAKER_00] I don't know. [SPEAKER_00] God damn it! I'm gonna do it in a bit. [SPEAKER_01] You do need a big lesson. Yes. See you, please. [SPEAKER_01] You're the sir? I was the sir. [SPEAKER_01] What did you see? I looked at two of the cells. [SPEAKER_01] Nice! What do you think? [SPEAKER_00] Strong play. Strong play. [SPEAKER_01] Drunk Play. [SPEAKER_00] Why wouldn't you volunteer that right away? [SPEAKER_00] It's pretty soon into it. It is. Yeah, pretty soon. [SPEAKER_01] It's pretty soon into it. It is. Yeah, pretty soon. They were only admitted in, really. [SPEAKER_01] And there's not that much more information. There's still three unknown people. [SPEAKER_00] Did you wake up this year? Yes, did. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, I'm certain I can't win at this point correct? [SPEAKER_01] with no werewolves or my misunderstandings. I know a minion can win as long as a villager dies. Mm hmm. [SPEAKER_00] I know a mini... [SPEAKER_01] in this case. If this is true. [SPEAKER_00] So you just switch with the Mitch. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I hate to say it. So if I was to say this, you guys don't believe me if I, well, you would, it would be crazy. And if I said this, you don't believe me. [SPEAKER_01] So I'm... [SPEAKER_01] Obviously the answer is this. [SPEAKER_01] I'm almost like like nothing. No, it's this one here. Okay, so if we kill the minion, where will win? If there's where wills, which there's not, because they're there. But does that do anything to the where wills as the minion is killed by themselves? [SPEAKER_00] I'm almost like like not this one here [SPEAKER_00] Win. [SPEAKER_01] If the men still by himself and there's no werewolves, the villagers win. [SPEAKER_01] If, sorry, I know you. If the minion is killed and there are no werewolves, the villagers win. [SPEAKER_00] if I [SPEAKER_01] If I started as a drunk, if I picked up one of those two and we killed a minion, I would win. If I picked up this one, we killed a minion. [SPEAKER_00] And we killed. [SPEAKER_01] then we always. So the question is, I'm in midsures of where we joined the live pickup. Which one did you pick at? [SPEAKER_00] I mean, clear as a wh sew. [SPEAKER_00] Which one did you pick up? [SPEAKER_00] Let's go match. [SPEAKER_00] let's do it [SPEAKER_01] I already said which one I picked up. You're saying the pick of this one? That's the one I said, yeah. But isn't it a safer bet? I told you what I said. Town, isn't it a safer bet to kill Mitchell over Caitlin? Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Listen... [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] in the safer bed. [SPEAKER_00] QYcer. Yes? Cisco should hurry up. Yes. Yes. Yes. Of certain characters on ourselves? [SPEAKER_01] But doesn't Vinnyn win if a girl you guys killed? Mm-hmm. No, yep. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, I wish. Yeah, so if I picked that one and you killed me, she wins. But if I take this one... If I take this one... [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] So the switch is a wheel off yet. [SPEAKER_01] and you kill her, I win. That's a hard choice. Mitch, let's just kill her. The only way we can all win is if I picked this one and we kill her. [SPEAKER_00] The only [SPEAKER_00] Let's go match. [SPEAKER_01] The only way. That's the only way we can... Most of us could... Most of us could... Most of us could... Let's go, Mesh. [SPEAKER_00] Most of us come out. [SPEAKER_01] Thank you. [SPEAKER_00] You start to wear wool. [SPEAKER_01] An\uc218\ufffdot we've all been running into Now dass [SPEAKER_00] I'm not going. [SPEAKER_01] The view, I mean yes. [SPEAKER_00] The viewer, I mean yeah. [SPEAKER_01] There you go. Yes, kill miss. Well, that's the minion adds a weird aspect. Because it wouldn't matter if we'd killed off MjV, it was just the robber after he switched them. Oh, you guys... I was certain the whole group loses if you... Kill off a villager? No. You have a minion wins. No, no, no, no, no. If they're what, go minion. If they're here, sorry. The whole group loses if you kill off a villager, do you know? Yes, that's right. Oh, yes, that's right. Yeah, okay. So really, the only added aspect is I win and you guys lose. We have 38 seconds. I've done it from the beginning. You have to bang that I picked up this card and if we kill her, we all win. [SPEAKER_00] What are you guys doing? [SPEAKER_00] Kill off a villager? No. [SPEAKER_00] We don't know, but if they're watching, we're sorry. And we... [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, so yeah, oh yeah [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] I AM THE RIDDING OF I PICK! [SPEAKER_00] only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_00] Sounds like a win. I'm a Rachel, so he's trying to flushes a win. I don't like it. So these two are... So these two are... [SPEAKER_01] So these two are both pointing to Mitchell. Who are you feeling you want to point to? [SPEAKER_01] schon beans und, [SPEAKER_01] Well, it's a safer bet, right? I don't... It's a loss. It's a loss. [SPEAKER_00] I don't [SPEAKER_00] \u0647\u0646\u0627 \u064a\u062a\u0646\u062e\u064a\u0648\u0646 \u0646SA [SPEAKER_01] You're a piece of wormhole. Fuck. He's a wormhole.

I swished with this one, did you look about one? I did look at that one. What did you see? I'm not gonna say. Okay. Because two people are playing me drum right now. [SPEAKER_03] because two people are claiming... [SPEAKER_04] I was awake enough. [SPEAKER_04] Hmm? How was it waking up? [SPEAKER_04] Was it? [SPEAKER_04] or [SPEAKER_04] Oh. [SPEAKER_02] He was... [SPEAKER_02] What? There was a bit more hair. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I don't know, I don't know. What are you, and you guys give some issues? I can't get this. [SPEAKER_04] I said I was the drunk. These guys are both cleaning drunk. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_03] and I search for the middle. [SPEAKER_04] Do I have to claim something? And you guys will just like take care of this? [SPEAKER_02] And James and James isn't getting all what if I just [SPEAKER_04] What if I just... [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_03] other. [SPEAKER_03] Well the trunk holds no weight, my fate is really in if the seer saw anything. [SPEAKER_03] because I really don't know when I am. I just know that I was the drunk. [SPEAKER_03] Look, I really risked nothing by volunteering the information saying, hey, I switched with this. [SPEAKER_03] But if he said that I would not [SPEAKER_02] You're not claiming to be the drunk. You're the thing, bro. You're still claiming to be the sinner. [SPEAKER_03] receive the drum. [SPEAKER_00] Thank you. [SPEAKER_04] nothing [SPEAKER_03] Is it both you playing with the suits of the Senate? That's bullshit, you're just talking to my story like mid- You're fucking using the existing! [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_04] the [SPEAKER_04] Here's the craziest thing, we got a bit more foot because... [SPEAKER_04] I saw from Mike and I did not see a seer. [SPEAKER_02] That's bullshit! [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_02] I was like, what's this here? So you did not- I have- [SPEAKER_00] I was like, what's this? [SPEAKER_01] I had a really dramatic free night. I went to sleep in this and saw a maniac. You went to the business all. [SPEAKER_03] You went to the business all next, that's a lie. Alright. [SPEAKER_01] And I didn't fall asleep and then I was just awake as an insomnia. [SPEAKER_01] So, fuck. So who is the seer? And who's the seer? And who's the drunk? [SPEAKER_03] How is the- [SPEAKER_03] Mike, if you were to see your what was the center card, if you looked at it, it was a wearable. [SPEAKER_01] Oh shit. So both of you are now witch-fine was the drunk. Who's now the wher- Get lost, bitch! [SPEAKER_02] Check to both of you! [SPEAKER_04] What's that name? What's that name? What's that name? [SPEAKER_02] Why was the minion? [SPEAKER_04] Oh, that's true. One of them is away. [SPEAKER_02] one of them is the minion. Bye! [SPEAKER_03] But Mike wasn't a C-err-grantur, you know backing him up? [SPEAKER_04] I'm backing them up. I was just... That sounds so quiet. That's all I talk. [SPEAKER_03] That sounds so cool. Why is that so awesome? What is that for? [SPEAKER_01] Is that for? Is this just a stir in the pot? I don't like bifing. [SPEAKER_02] I don't like, I think this is what's happening right now. [SPEAKER_04] What do you think, Mitchell? I can't be together yet. [SPEAKER_02] I think we're outnumbered. I disagree. [SPEAKER_03] Bye! [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_04] I just don't see how three people could fuck up that much as were wolves. I don't think it's better. I don't think they would both declare drunk if they were both, if we were all on the same team. [SPEAKER_02] \uadf8 \uc2dc\uc6d0\ud55c \ub290\ub08c\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4.. [SPEAKER_03] No. [SPEAKER_03] I'm starting to question Mike as a C.E.R. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] I am the seer, I am not lying. I don't know. [SPEAKER_03] I don't know I don't know about this I don't know about this. Oh, I'm backing you up now thing [SPEAKER_02] I don't know about that either. I'm not involved in that. I... [SPEAKER_03] If I had to place a hunch, just because I can't get from my own store, I think this year is in the middle. [SPEAKER_03] Not the middle middle, the middle three. But I was the drunk and I switched to the middle. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_04] I was the dr- [SPEAKER_04] What if I said I was just doing that shit with my, because like Mitchell, I stole from James. And I can confirm that he was not the drunk. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] \u6628\u5929\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u600e\u4e48\u6837 [SPEAKER_03] Why are you changing your story three fucking times? [SPEAKER_02] fucking times he did my question because he got the werewolf [SPEAKER_02] You were the werewolf then. [SPEAKER_01] And she- If you were the werewolf, he no has it. Do you want to admit to having the werewolf? No. [SPEAKER_02] Think she does it, Oh, [SPEAKER_03] I wasn't the fuck, and we were the drivers of the drunk. [SPEAKER_01] We're in the trough of this big trunk. I believe you. [SPEAKER_03] If he was the drunk... [SPEAKER_04] I looked at my car and looked at it really hard. James, it was not the drunk. [SPEAKER_01] It's just not- [SPEAKER_01] Who do you believe like? Or who do you think's the way well? 40 seconds. [SPEAKER_02] Well there was only one more out because I didn't see a werewolf and a trouble maker. [SPEAKER_03] You saw a chalk maker right there? [SPEAKER_03] Yeah. Okay, Mike's not the fucking seer. I was the werewolf. I saw the fucking werewolf right there. Okay, then just as a fucking werewolf. If you did, actually, go from here. Just as... [SPEAKER_02] Okay, that's good. [SPEAKER_02] Did you actually stole from me? Just as a wearable. And she's the drunk. Yeah. Which one do you switch with? The mid center one. So she's trouble maker because I switched them because you both were claiming the center. Wow. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, we watch only this, you switch lets. [SPEAKER_00] The scraper? [SPEAKER_03] Gang Justin [SPEAKER_03] I don't want to wait 10-9 seconds. Time is up. Everyone. [SPEAKER_00] 3"}

[SPEAKER_01] What what did you do? So no we're right right right now. We're saying no one is a [SPEAKER_01] Where will they do you not play the role properly although miss was a drunk [SPEAKER_00] Although Mitch was a drunk, this is a damn terrible. [SPEAKER_01] But how could you possibly know what God is doing? [SPEAKER_00] I wanna know what God said to me! [SPEAKER_01] Let's stop us from voting Mitchell. [SPEAKER_01] No, I didn't do anything to make sure. [SPEAKER_01] Then what did you do? [SPEAKER_01] Because at this point it's looking like Mitchell. You're listening. You're listening shouldn't have, right? No, no, no. [SPEAKER_00] You'll probably think Du 10 [SPEAKER_00] No. [SPEAKER_01] is [SPEAKER_01] uh... who can back up who's story uh... i came back up her she was that i was a serious trouble i'm awake i woke up as the robber [SPEAKER_00] Thank you for having me. [SPEAKER_01] And that was back this up. Sorry, just simply, I don't care what your roles are. Who can back up who? Just point at who? I can't get who. You can back her up? I can confirm I am now. So you can back me up. You can back. And you can back. I didn't look at the card. [SPEAKER_00] I can't get right. You can back her up. [SPEAKER_00] So you can back me up. Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_01] Oh, yeah, that's all you fucked it up. Okay. [SPEAKER_01] This is a possibility. [SPEAKER_01] Oh, cause they're only... [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] And then she saw the childmaker. [SPEAKER_00] I. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] No, because you'd have to be the troublemaker for me to... for us... for me to... [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, because you were the insomnia you were the seer at the start right? Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah [SPEAKER_01] So what? I was getting that. Because she was the start, he was the start, she switched them. Then I... [SPEAKER_00] Because she was a c- [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, it makes sense. I'm sorry, who's backing up? Okay, so he was the seer. We can back that up. [SPEAKER_00] an [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_01] No, cuz I never looked at my card. Yeah, you never looked at me. He should be this year. He fucked up. He fucked up by not looking at his card when he robbed it. [SPEAKER_00] he has prepared his duty to observe this and to avoid it he answers no more [SPEAKER_00] You should be this year. [SPEAKER_01] That is the serial though. He robbed that card and didn't look at it. Oh, that classic fuckup. I mean, he should still be able to look at it, because he, no. No. Well, I shouldn't be able to. [SPEAKER_00] \uadf8\ub798\uc694 [SPEAKER_00] I mean [SPEAKER_00] Well, I should have been... [SPEAKER_01] So can we confirm for a fact that he's a seer? Well, I'm still not seeing why this isn't a possibility. [SPEAKER_01] because Mike was... Because James was the insomnia. For this, stories even work out. This couldn't happen to me because... To wake up the robber, that story has to check out. I have to be the trouble. [SPEAKER_00] This is the Insight. For this... [SPEAKER_00] dish. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] I have to go to trouble maker. Yeah, so that's not possible. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] That makes sense, yeah, you're right, James. [SPEAKER_00] The only person up in here Sorry, yeah Yep Mentor your sub [SPEAKER_01] Sorry, yeah, yeah, I could just be saying she's the total maker she didn't reveal it first and I never had a chance to De-re-veal anything [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I could... [SPEAKER_01] What if we just don't vote left? [SPEAKER_01] No but Mitch, if our story checks out, he is... What if you all vote left? And then the minion will still lose. He's second.

[SPEAKER_01] This could be real good. This could be an O. Is there a robber out there? [SPEAKER_01] Okay, great. I was a minion and he was a werewolf. And so now you swapped it. And I know he's a werewolf and he's not a robber. He claimed robber. He must have saw a robber in the middle I'm guessing. Then he swapped it and now we got a minion sitting over there. So now we got minion and a werewolf. Allen and Salmon. [SPEAKER_01] Would you wake up? [SPEAKER_03] for us. [SPEAKER_01] this Like [SPEAKER_02] Find them and don't be destroyed. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] That makes me see her. [SPEAKER_01] I looked in the center. Interesting. Did you see Robert? I saw a drunk. [SPEAKER_01] and where will. [SPEAKER_01] That would have been good to see you're all right. [SPEAKER_02] Mm hmm. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] So Mitch is immediately putting me under the bus. We're all agree on that right? Oh yeah [SPEAKER_00] Oh yeah! No. [SPEAKER_03] which is hilarious. I like it. I like it. You can miss me solid story. Thank you. Solid story. It's fine. [SPEAKER_01] Thank you. It's so legendary. I'm not giving up. I didn't think it would help. It was pretty good. Does anyone not wanna go to the phone? [SPEAKER_02] everyone heard of the [SPEAKER_03] Who? No one, Mike. Mike interacted with no one as a seer, no one interacted with Mike. So whatever Mike says could be bullshit. Yes. [SPEAKER_00] My [SPEAKER_01] That's it we've got Mike! [SPEAKER_01] And what? [SPEAKER_01] You minionets [SPEAKER_03] Oh no. [SPEAKER_01] Because he could be a werewolf, he could have been that drunk. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_01] So you were a minion. I was a minion. I will come to you. [SPEAKER_03] What are you aware of Justin beyond? [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_01] I mean, he's still there, so I don't know if he's gonna say that. [SPEAKER_02] new new new new new new new new [SPEAKER_00] Want more viewers? [SPEAKER_01] If you are Robert, who do you rob? [SPEAKER_02] So would you find more believable if I said if I said Mitchell if I said K1 that you rob from yeah [SPEAKER_03] I was an insomniac. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_03] No ecosystem recognizes the [SPEAKER_01] I woke up as a minion. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] So then that case the answer would be Mitchell. I was just testing the waters to see what answers you got to find must believe it. I like you. You could have robbed one of us too. I don't want to. No, I don't. No, I don't. [SPEAKER_03] Like you could have rob what a bestie. I don't trust Mike as well as Justin. I agree Justin's a smart choice, but I don't trust Mike because he just interacted with no one and no one interacted with him. His story could be fine but there's no way to crawl over him. Mike's the world's the world of murder. [SPEAKER_01] I was meaning to I did get to see who all the werels are and I just saw one were just saw one. Yeah [SPEAKER_03] And I was just yeah and I was so ready to back [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, and I was so ready to back them up and then you switched my car And I was like I'll throw them under the bus [SPEAKER_02] You know, that's life, right? One second, you have a minute. Next second. [SPEAKER_03] in the next second. Wasn't that way. Thank you. So wait, sorry, who are we missing here? [SPEAKER_03] Oh, there's a rock. [SPEAKER_01] There's a robber here which I'm guessing just some woke up as a werewolf and he saw the robber. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, it's pretty solid. Unless, you know, Mike is also lying, right? But I will... What if he was the robber? [SPEAKER_03] What if he was the robber? [SPEAKER_03] and you robbed the warehouse [SPEAKER_02] Where were? Yeah, he robbed me. [SPEAKER_01] And now I'm the way well. I mean that's possibility. That is possibility, but it wasn't. I was just here. Because how would I know there was no seer available? [SPEAKER_01] Good. You will... Get a sun Iranian knowledge True [SPEAKER_03] Could you really draw a draw? True. But I don't know. That's a good one. That's a good one, yes. [SPEAKER_01] But I know, I know. It's a good one, Jason. That's a good one. [SPEAKER_03] Bye, I think all is there voting for Justin. Justin's only smart choice. [SPEAKER_01] Bu- [SPEAKER_03] I'm with missile but you could be playing a fan, or a bastard, fucking miss could be like... [SPEAKER_01] or ask it, fucking mish could be lying. That could be. Yeah, mish. Oh, I might as well. I could probably be doing.

[SPEAKER_01] I was a minion and I saw him as a werewolf. You saw him for what he really was? Yes! [SPEAKER_03] You saw for what he really was. Yes. OK. You look really good. You switched our cards. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] \u0418 \u0432\u043e\u043e\u0431\u0449\u0435 \u043d\u0435\u0442. [SPEAKER_03] I was in insomnia. I just thought, well you won't have to say what to mean in the eyes. Okay. So. [SPEAKER_00] I just don't believe... [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_00] Maybe even a second. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, my votes locked. She could have been aware of too. [SPEAKER_01] This she could have been a way away. [SPEAKER_01] But then I don't know why he'd be pushing me. And me will be 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_03] Why would I admit to being a minion if I didn't know that I was a minion and not a good enough? [SPEAKER_03] Okay. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_03] I really just saying your minion and your actually aware will cause you don't want the vote but I felt really strongly from Mitchell's case and I don't like when you guys swing me away from dumbbell to four. So man, I'm on your dumbbell to four. [SPEAKER_02] I really just think they're a minute. [SPEAKER_01] and you're actually aware of what you don't want to vote. [SPEAKER_02] No man, no man, you don't know the floor. But it for me is the most logical one. I just don't want to get fucked if Mike was the robber. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] No vote for me. I think it was great. [SPEAKER_00] Um, [SPEAKER_03] And of all for me. Congratulations, a great bus! Free!"}

[SPEAKER_02] Don't kill me! We're good! We got all of us on the same team! [SPEAKER_01] I think Mitchell is in the way. But then again, if that means, that would be that you would be the... [SPEAKER_02] I know, I know which is, but then again, if that means, that would mean that you would be the werewolf, because I switched you to. You switched us? Yeah, I can come from that 100%. He's not the werewolf, because I wasn't the werewolf. All right, so then I trust him, because he doesn't want us to move for Paul. Yeah, yeah, don't move for Paul, even if you didn't switch us. [SPEAKER_01] Ist was das? Ja. [SPEAKER_02] Sammy's Paul, if you were the wearer for the beginning, he wasn't. If we were... [SPEAKER_01] He wasn't.

Yeah, right. There's no majority, no one dies. And us three villagers live happily ever after. I don't trust you for some weird reason though. I just don't know. Yeah, I'm here. I'm here for myself, so I'm transitable. But yeah, like, I don't know, but you would. I'm really, ever, ever. You would vote for like, yeah, I feel like, why would you be going along with this if you know I switched them? Because he would lose. Yeah, if I was a werewolf and you told me we'd switch them. But what if you guys are both werewolves? Right. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, right. [SPEAKER_01] I don't trust you for some way of reason [SPEAKER_00] Thank you!

Yeah, if you were both where I was, if we were both where I was, and we knew, we would just vote you out. Yeah. Yeah, that would be a kind of game breaking at that point. Yeah. It'd be so easy.

I feel bad because I [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Stand up just and don't- [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] I killed this all last game, I'm sorry. You did? Yeah. Redeme yourself. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, tell us your truths. This is a werewolf. How is that a damn thing? What are you talking about? I believe it. I'll stand by it. I was a villager from the beginning. [SPEAKER_01] How was that a damn thing? [SPEAKER_00] The fuck is he doing? Hot, what were you? How do you know? [SPEAKER_00] Let's see what we're going to do together. [SPEAKER_00] He was a werewolf. But now he's saying I'm a werewolf. I'm not a werewolf. I was just joking around, bro. Bro. [SPEAKER_01] I'm not aware of it. [SPEAKER_00] Alright, I was a village at all. I really was. [SPEAKER_00] You guys? [SPEAKER_00] Elders, Elders are up. [SPEAKER_00] 3 bilgees? 3 bilgees? You can go with that? Almost to the left! Okay, I was a trouble maker, so we know what happened. Oh, jeez! [SPEAKER_01] Oh [SPEAKER_01] George [SPEAKER_00] It's trouble maker optional. Yes, it's a Mac. It's a Mac. [SPEAKER_01] Yes. [SPEAKER_00] didn't know that. [SPEAKER_00] Y'all were splashed. So are you aware of it now? No, I was a robber. [SPEAKER_01] Ja, er ist verletzt. [SPEAKER_00] em! [SPEAKER_00] I can confirm. [SPEAKER_00] You were a bilger. So the gold werewolves are the middle again? Yeah. So the war? He was a werewolf and he's... No, not this, but this and then this. Yeah, correct. Correct. [SPEAKER_01] you [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, correct. [SPEAKER_00] So either of all villagers get, or he was a war wolf and he saw a childmaker and he's taking the band of it. [SPEAKER_00] I'm not there you are. No. [SPEAKER_00] No, I'm in the trouble, Nick. [SPEAKER_00] I think that's what the three player is gonna always come down to though. Unless there's two werewolves. [SPEAKER_01] no curse [SPEAKER_00] There's not enough stories to check. Check. Especially when someone says they're a villager. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, tip check. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, which you are. Yeah, I saw your card. Yeah, I agree with that. I agree with that [SPEAKER_01] What you are? Yeah, I saw your [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, there's no T. [SPEAKER_01] I agree with you. [SPEAKER_00] Because then we know somebody was just like, oh, no. Suri 100% Logisky's a trouble maker? Yeah. All right, that was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] Sur\u00f6hUNDARSA Ground [SPEAKER_00] So we should kill Mitchell. Yeah. I was. No, you were. No, because I was the werewolf. No, you weren't. Yeah, I was. No. I was the werewolf from the beginning. And now he's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] I was the wearable. No, you weren't. Yeah, I was. I was the wearable. [SPEAKER_00] Everyone is both tet Phys tut [SPEAKER_00] I was a werewolf. And now he is a werewolf. He is defending because he wants to win as the werewolf. So you weren't ever the wrong. No, I was the werewolf from the beginning. He fucking won. And I looked in. And he knew I was the werewolf because he took it from me. He was the robber. No. And he took it from me. And he was trying to hide it. And then we realized you're a trouble maker. Here's the thing that you can prove that I was a werewolf because Mitch actually declared himself as a villager before I declared myself as anybody. So I feel like as a werewolf, which I was, I didn't want to make any deck of weapons. And I was the second to go. I want the record to go down second time telling the truth and it's not going through. Telling me what's up. Every werewolf. I was the joke. And I jokingly said I'm a villager because I saw villager. It was this one when I was a little. You're doing that. What is that? I was the judge. Yeah. I'm a girl. It was the second time. Should we go? I want the record to go down second time telling the truth and it's not going through. Telling me what's up. Every werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] You weren't ever the wrong. No, I was the where- [SPEAKER_01] And I looked in. [SPEAKER_01] Here's here [SPEAKER_01] He called me out as a wherever I did as a joke [SPEAKER_01] What is that? Absolutely just in offense. Yeah, I'm with you. Is this the second time?"}

I don't know what's going on. What did you do? You switched me in. I want to hear what you are before I reveal what I do. But you would have, the trouble maker has to switch to other players. It's a maze. Oh but okay, but if you take an action, that's the only action you could take, right? No. Okay. Oh, Mitch is the insomniac. He knows he's the werewolf now. No, I'm the seeer and I saw two werewolves here. I was a werewolf. You switched us. Mitch is the insomniac. He knows he's a werewolf. That's what's up. Yeah, that is not what's up.

I was starting this with Weirwolf. I see I'm going to be giving you guys that two Weirwolves right here. No, this one is not a Weirwolf. I don't know why you guys would... Listen, this is how you know. The mystery cannot, there's no way the mystery check's out. I started as a Weirwolf. If I started as a villager or something else, I would not be lying about that. There would be no reason to be lying about that. This is the card I looked at. It was a Weirwolf and I was like, fuck, that gives me no information. Great, thank you. Except Mitch's giving bullshit about Weirwolf cards are... I- [SPEAKER_01] I would start as a real big [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] I don't know why you guys were... [SPEAKER_01] Listen, this is how you know. It just breaks. [SPEAKER_00] I studied Assistant Tabii Bez [SPEAKER_00] This is the card I looked. [SPEAKER_00] I know right out of the gates. I was like boom. I'm a seer. I got loads of info. These are where we're you made of it you [SPEAKER_02] You switched them. You switched them. So now he's the Werewolf. He started with the Insomniac. He knows he's now a Werewolf because he got to see it, right? At the end. So that's why he's giving this BS away. I started with the CNR. [SPEAKER_01] Your middle life is doing. [SPEAKER_00] I started with the scene and I saw one where we'll miss another one. Are you the robber? I was not the robber. [SPEAKER_01] Would you the Robert, did you steal a werewolf from Paul? Or... [SPEAKER_02] Or if I did that [SPEAKER_00] If I did that, I would be kind of confident that maybe you switched us back and I would say something and I did not do that. I was not the robber. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I just don't get why you guys are both saying that he's this. No, but I don't understand what's happening on them the fact that maybe you guys are both way worse again. [SPEAKER_02] No, we're not. I'm the only werewolf. I was the only we're are two werewolves [SPEAKER_00] primero [SPEAKER_00] This is so fucked. This is so fucked. I feel like we went through an extra whirlpool cart. Yeah, no, that's it. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, no, this is giving me two because I'm like what? Because I was the only one who switches. [SPEAKER_01] I was the only one who did you switch us? [SPEAKER_02] No! I was the only werewolf. I did him! [SPEAKER_02] You get it? I get it. [SPEAKER_00] \u8c01 gave him! [SPEAKER_02] If you did the switches, then I would. [SPEAKER_00] still wearable. [SPEAKER_00] But then how did you see two were we? I didn't, I saw one were we'll. I was a seer and I looked at his and it was a were we'll. Oh and then you were back. As soon as you pulled the troll make card, I got scared and I said, there are two in the middle. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] Oh, and then you were a bitch. [SPEAKER_02] and I say, bye bye. [SPEAKER_00] So we kill Paul it's Paul if you do that so I don't know [SPEAKER_01] That's what I thought."}

[SPEAKER_02] Yeah, yeah, so. [SPEAKER_00] So we got a robber and an himself over here. [SPEAKER_02] So we have a possible where we'll. [SPEAKER_01] What were you just I was a troublemaker? [SPEAKER_00] I was a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_00] And I switched you guys. [SPEAKER_00] I'll give that up freely because I believe you guys tell in your, I believe this story that you guys are making here. Like not making up, like the story that is going on here.

[SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] He saw it till later. That is not correct. [SPEAKER_01] If he was a troublemaker for real... [SPEAKER_01] I probably... [SPEAKER_01] What have noticed? You would have.

[SPEAKER_01] Yes. [SPEAKER_01] You were the robber this whole time. [SPEAKER_01] I thought you were the seer because I woke up with the Insomac. [SPEAKER_00] Did you switch the overmute? Yeah, I switched it overmute. And I switched it guys back. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, and I switched it from you and I switched it guys back. [SPEAKER_00] I'll check so you know [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] You would know it had no information that... No, kids, I knew it was one of these two, but since I woke up with the same person, I was like, must be seer because if it was Robert, we would have switched. [SPEAKER_02] Day \u0442\u0435\u043f. [SPEAKER_01] That was my logic. Yeah, I was just wrong. Okay. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I was just wrong. Okay, so I thought you were a seer and you saw me. No, my whole point was that you should have woken up seeing the robber card. Right, no, why I knew what you were. Yeah, because I had it. I woke up with an... [SPEAKER_00] Inner [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] So yeah, let's go to the salt checks out. [SPEAKER_00] I mean, like there's no way that it could be. Is it possible he's lying?

[SPEAKER_00] You probably would keep your mouth shut at this point, doesn't it? [SPEAKER_01] You probably would keep your mouth shut at this point. It doesn't look good for me. [SPEAKER_00] The question is, which one of these two is that? [SPEAKER_00] Well, I'm on the good team, so I'll tell the truth. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] I was in time here and I woke up as myself. [SPEAKER_00] most stuff [SPEAKER_01] Wish you well for me. I mean, this is pretty airtight. [SPEAKER_02] You're fucking lying. You're both lying. [SPEAKER_02] It's so straight. Are you? Are you both were? No, you both are. That's that this is that thing that you guys do. What do we do? Love your shoes? No, no, like where you are in a team with each other and it's like a secret. I'm like, I can never tell. That. [SPEAKER_00] That's it! [SPEAKER_00] I woke up as myself and that's why I'm scared shitless because you're both werewolves [SPEAKER_01] Man, Mitch's voice has a weird cadence right now that makes me think he's up to something. Man, I always... [SPEAKER_00] Man, Mitch's voice. [SPEAKER_00] man I always I always sense this fishers. [SPEAKER_00] Remember the first round when I was a serial and I saw two worlds and no one believed me? So you woke up as [SPEAKER_01] So you woke up as an insomniac and why are you relying? [SPEAKER_00] Why do you really... [SPEAKER_00] No, first, first greater Zarhanfeel is T personal truth, that's real beauty I don't know. [SPEAKER_01] Well, first gear you saw the truth, I killed them. [SPEAKER_01] So you're not a robber or a toll maker? [SPEAKER_00] Now. [SPEAKER_00] He was this year, right? Yeah, I was this year. [SPEAKER_01] it [SPEAKER_01] You're the werewolf? If you had to kill one of us, who would you kill? You. Why? You're the werewolf. What if I'm the seer? [SPEAKER_02] You're not you would have fucking said something by now I know trying to gauge if he the only way here in the series if he's actually the trouble. No, I'm trying to [SPEAKER_01] I'm trying to gauge a key only [SPEAKER_01] I'm trying to gauge out if he was the robber and he stole from me. [SPEAKER_01] No. I'm trying to get it out from here. Uh, could be. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Keep your mind. [SPEAKER_02] Wait, which I went first, right? See you, yeah, Robert's been here the end, right with friends on the academic. Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_01] It's a seer robber troublemaker in Salt Meak. [SPEAKER_01] because he's only an extra safe bet. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] Not any excess here. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I feel like that's kind of bullshit. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I feel... [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Justin Swearwell. So what happens if we both vote for Mitchell? [SPEAKER_01] Again. [SPEAKER_00] than I die. Yeah. And where will it be? The original where will it be? So either go off what you see or what the guy that you saw as a where wolf is telling you. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] Go right. [SPEAKER_02] Are you admitting you started as a level? Yeah, you would do that if you wanted to. How much did you want to start? [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] You could do that if you wanted to. I'm a minute that I started as a werewolf. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] and I was in Sommye and I saw myself as in Sommye. So I know you weren't a trove me. That's why I was able to guess that you were a seer. [SPEAKER_02] So I know [SPEAKER_00] because, and you and the children make your, you're doing a robbery, you have a big brother. You have a big brother. [SPEAKER_01] You're doing a robber.

I can't, I- [SPEAKER_02] I can't I okay so Justin is still where will for this you're the robber no [SPEAKER_01] No, I... [SPEAKER_01] I think he... I mean, yeah, he won't be dead. Maybe it's... but... [SPEAKER_01] So, I'm too much money to trust. [SPEAKER_00] But do you trust the guy who you know it started as a war wolf? [SPEAKER_00] or she trusts the person you don't know anything about. [SPEAKER_00] But default, I should be trusted. 13th, I guess. You're so shady about it. I know. So shady about everything when I play this game. [SPEAKER_02] here's so [SPEAKER_02] Nada. [SPEAKER_00] I mean, I totally could be another wolf even. Okay, I think Justin's the one who's the one who's the wolf. [SPEAKER_02] Look, two out of three chains thrown over. [SPEAKER_00] Look, two out of three chains thrown.

But if it does, it's not coming out of the center. Correct. That's all the talk that does that. These are both werewolves. These are both werewolves. Yeah. You're the insomniac. I'm the insomniac. What are you? Is the Trouble maker. Did you just switch? Why? [SPEAKER_01] That's a trouble maker. [SPEAKER_01] You can't do it with yourself. Robert also has... [SPEAKER_01] Everything's a mess.

[SPEAKER_00] No. [SPEAKER_00] It's one of these two. [SPEAKER_00] Huh? Well, I was a robber. [SPEAKER_00] and you stole from Paul. And I stole from Paul. Paul, what did you wake up at? [SPEAKER_01] This one's hard. This one's a goddamn chest puzzle. I don't even know what the fuck my strategy is right now. [SPEAKER_00] I already even... [SPEAKER_01] Well, did you wake up as a robber? I'm so confused. No, I'm at meet 2. [SPEAKER_00] What did you see when you looked at this card? I think look at it, I sure have been to that. [SPEAKER_00] I don't believe that per second. I saw an insomniac. I think Mitch started with the Tanner. I saw an insomniac when I have Robert and I switched it for an insomniac. [SPEAKER_00] and so you woke up as the robber. [SPEAKER_00] Unless he's doing some sort of weird switching thing. Oh, there's no trouble maker. I only took out. [SPEAKER_00] I'm scared. [SPEAKER_01] This is the case, it's... Fuck. [SPEAKER_00] So you store from Paul? [SPEAKER_00] And what did you see? I saw him and saw him, yeah. Okay, he's telling the truth.

No, I never looked in the center. [SPEAKER_00] No, I didn't. Which one did you, who'd you look at? [SPEAKER_00] You want it here? [SPEAKER_00] No, I just know you're lying.

I think we got to all vote to the left. We can't kill anybody. [SPEAKER_00] He's a werewolf, do you? But you saw his card. No, he's not talking to me. [SPEAKER_00] I'm probably going to go with it.

[SPEAKER_00] I think there's a war in our interest. I think there might be a war war. Are you okay with owning left? I think it might be Paul. So should we vote right then? [SPEAKER_01] You're the one I don't trust. [SPEAKER_01] Are you okay with running? [SPEAKER_00] I don't know. [SPEAKER_00] We have nine seconds. Where's everyone voting? [SPEAKER_00] I'm going to...

[SPEAKER_01] So that's why I think James is not in the truth because he put two things down. That's true. Right. [SPEAKER_02] That's true. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I'd just be going for a very... No. I'd have to agree. [SPEAKER_01] I'd have to agree I think that's world you probably sort of really I mean it makes sense it checks out a little bit [SPEAKER_02] So, a little bit. [SPEAKER_01] That will go again. [SPEAKER_02] Huh, let's just go Mike. I'm on board. Spots, Julie. Conjures. Yeah, but he's on my nerves. OK, that's two for Mike. Alvin. Mike Trayn. Trayn, the two of you leaving the station. Alvin Trayn. You want us to tell you here? Wait, wait, you decide who was saying that Alvin just no Mitch Pratt. [SPEAKER_01] Conjuries. Yes, I can tell. Yep. [SPEAKER_01] Do you want us to tell you? Wait for more. [SPEAKER_00] Remember owling and it took all caution & catcode yesterday afternoon. [SPEAKER_01] No Mitch Pog. I put it there just process of elimination was the last thing. So he hasn't really... [SPEAKER_02] He hasn't really denied it. I need I need one more [SPEAKER_01] got to send him I cast in Mic [SPEAKER_01] I just feel like if Ellen was the Tanner he would try to do something. Yeah, that would switch it up a little bit. I don't think Ellen's gonna love her. Yeah, I think we could do that too. [SPEAKER_02] if you were\u3092... [SPEAKER_02] I don't like that. I don't like that. Yeah, I'll see you in the lover. You can do that too. I think he's just like, ooh, I've been made. Well that's too bad. That's why I'm asking. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] for sure. I don't know what happened to you twice. It did. [SPEAKER_02] One of the chances was that it was a good point. Yeah, good point. Yeah, it was a good chance to meet you. Yeah, a 10 or twice. Yeah. It's like, though, but I was. Oh, Mike, so Julie's story probably checks out, so. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, good one of the chances to meet you out. [SPEAKER_01] and mix your stove for me. I did. All right, who would you kill here? It would have to be Mike so far. Okay, that's four on four. The Mike's turn. It'll be like, I'm still, I would not be ready to go to vote right now, but if I had to, it would be Mike. One minute remains. They're trying to like punch another hole in the story here. You can't. Because I feel something feels fishy to me. Well, hi. [SPEAKER_02] It would have to be Mike so far. Okay, that's for the Mike's turn. Why did it not align? I'm still... [SPEAKER_00] one minute remain. [SPEAKER_02] Well, I- These, I honest to f- Fuck, I'm not sure I believe Justin. These are the roles I'm sure up in the air, but I'm so common in the mind. Why don't you believe me? [SPEAKER_01] Why don't you believe me? I asked you. What? I asked you. I know, but the drunk's just too easy. The drunk is one of the hardest and scariest roles to play. What if he didn't stand for the different role? What if he didn't stand for the different role? Okay. No. [SPEAKER_02] What if he's [SPEAKER_01] only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_00] 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_00] The reason why I feel like I think like Tanner the reason why I don't know if he's the Tanner [SPEAKER_01] notice I have nothing was revealed. If that's the case then he looked at albums and saw the Tanner. If he was the revealer he would have flipped over one of these cards. He has an 80% chance of that's the case. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Time is up! Everyone! Three! Two!"}

[SPEAKER_03] I can't burn. [SPEAKER_02] I think we can confirm there is a robber on the table. [SPEAKER_01] You just don't know who you're saying you stole [SPEAKER_03] So you're saying you stole from him? You're six. You would have looked at it here. You would have looked at it here.

[SPEAKER_02] Absolutely. I think we know who we're about tomorrow. If we're all good, I mean it's possible. We're all good. Yeah, I mean Yeah, but if we kill him we don't that's true [SPEAKER_03] I mean, he said he saw a robber. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] I can 100% confirm that my camel is a robber when I looked at the sea. Which it would check out for those five. [SPEAKER_03] it checks out to those five and then I robbed from you and then you looked. [SPEAKER_01] I appreciate that Jiren Cat is just bragging the whole time. I know everything! [SPEAKER_01] Okay. [SPEAKER_03] And I mean if Mitch actually was the troublemaker him switching us, she doesn't do anything. Yes. [SPEAKER_01] It doesn't matter anything. [SPEAKER_03] And not skilling a villager doesn't actually, I don't know where the box is. It's over there. [SPEAKER_03] I'm getting... [SPEAKER_02] Sure, I was gonna say if the werewolves are here then it Because we can't kill the pile [SPEAKER_01] So because we hit [SPEAKER_01] If we regard this kill lift, don't we win either way? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, look, look, look. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, I think so. Look, I'll come in. You saw a wind, and it should be killing you. That's fine. I'm not gonna defend it. That sounds good. I'm glad to be killed. Wait, is he the Tanner then? No. No, I don't think so. He's not trying. If he wants to be killed. Well, he does kind of, I mean, he's okay with it at this point. Don't smile. [SPEAKER_02] No. [SPEAKER_02] If you would want to be killed. Yeah. [SPEAKER_03] I'm sorry, just vote for me. Just kill me. Take me out of my misery. It's one thing to be an untrusted villager. But now you won't even kill me to save the village. Okay, let's just put this out there. Wasn't he trying from the beginning to get voted on? That's true, that is true. [SPEAKER_02] What was [SPEAKER_02] But, let's be clear, if we kill a villager [SPEAKER_03] and you end up being aware of this. [SPEAKER_02] or hear me out. Okay. I know for a fact that I am not a Tanner, and I am willing to take the hint before thinking that he's the Tanner. Yeah, but if he's actually a... [SPEAKER_03] were wolf and he wins then he wins because he's the only one that didn't really confer all right let's go Mitch yeah let's go Mitch I think we just go [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] Alright, let's kill Mitch. Yeah, let's kill Mitch. I think we just kill Mitch. Even the chat agree he's dying Mitch, huh? [SPEAKER_03] Alright, it's gonna- [SPEAKER_02] That's good about 3, 2, 1 All you miss out"}

[SPEAKER_01] You're not allowed to this timeless [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] All right, why are you hiding your role, werewolf? Oh my god, I bet it's so simple, don't you? All right, so does anyone have useful information about what they did at nighttime that could potentially help the villager team? Here are the villager roles that people are going to declare. Here is the Tanner that Mitch will probably declare. And here's the werewolf that Mike is. [SPEAKER_00] Alright, so does anyone have- [SPEAKER_01] Check so tracks out [SPEAKER_02] Although I want to know what you guys ordered. [SPEAKER_01] I'm just gonna wait a little bit. [SPEAKER_01] Bye. [SPEAKER_02] And then we're gonna wait like, like, like, we've long. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] So no one's gonna talk, so none of the villagers want to actually help the villagers win. That's cool. That's cool. [SPEAKER_02] It's a villager that doesn't have a lot of information. [SPEAKER_01] So that means you were the drunk? It's possible. I'm also not that helpful. So this is not the cake. If so, everybody knows. Because there's only one bad role for the villagers. That's not helpful to them. What is it? The drunk. [SPEAKER_02] So [SPEAKER_01] Why are any way how's it going invisible? Well the drum goes to the drum yeah, yeah, and moves things around No, it just exchanges the car with them in the center [SPEAKER_02] How's it going, invisible sandwich? The drug? No, we'll see the drug. Yeah. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] No, it's not just... [SPEAKER_02] and doesn't get a look at it. So unknown what they are at the end. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] So we made it, we wasted 90 seconds. Well, I know what I went to bed at night. Did you do something at night? Nothing, nothing at night. So that means that you were a Tanner? Yeah. OK, well, that's easy. If you want to say that, that's what I was. Mitch, what are you? [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Tanner [SPEAKER_02] I don't know. [SPEAKER_02] I'll narrow it down to... [SPEAKER_02] Two of them. How about that? Check out for it. I was one of these two. [SPEAKER_01] Let's go for it. [SPEAKER_01] Sick. I can confirm that someone at the table is lying. [SPEAKER_01] Because someone claimed a role that I went to badass. [SPEAKER_01] It's Mike, I was the drunk. [SPEAKER_01] Where are you? I was. Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] um... yeah i can't confirm [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Okay, so you robbed from him? I was and I had took the drunk car, I was seeing if he would. [SPEAKER_02] You were testing him. Yeah. But then he called you all right away. Yeah. Which is good. It's what I want. No. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, which is good. [SPEAKER_01] No, that's a weird thing to do. I don't know. Especially because right now I am literally assuming I'm a villager, but I could likely be a werewolf. Yeah. I could be anything at this point. So that's why I need other people to start talking. Otherwise, I'm going to assume I'm the werewolf, and I'm just going to kill somebody. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] So that's why I need a- [SPEAKER_02] Thank you. [SPEAKER_02] Okay, so... [SPEAKER_01] Okay, so. [SPEAKER_02] What in the heck is Mike doing here? Do we believe Mike? [SPEAKER_01] I don't believe anybody except for maybe Julie because I feel like she doesn't know what the Tanner does. No I do and I'm... Yeah. You okay with living? Yeah, fine. Okay, but you're not okay with living then. No she's playing a fucking werewolf. She's so good at lying. She's fucking with us. She's like, oh this is my first time playing. What's the Tanner do? [SPEAKER_00] You're okay with that? [SPEAKER_00] Start cooperating Herrmann's [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] Oh my god. So what were you actually? I was the trouble maker. I mixed two people up. He was one of them. [SPEAKER_02] God. [SPEAKER_02] So, what were you actually? I was the troublemaker. I mixed two people up. He was one of them. So now I'm trying to figure out what the heck he was. So did you just switch hasn't back? [SPEAKER_02] I don't want to, I don't want to do it. [SPEAKER_01] I put bars. We have about 90 seconds. [SPEAKER_02] I was enhancing the rubber. I stole from Justin. I saw the drunk. [SPEAKER_01] I was onvent to The Robert, I\u79fb a hundred cents... [SPEAKER_01] What did you say? Nothing. I was just saying no one's gonna say. [SPEAKER_02] And I'm going to say that he was the drunk because I didn't think he was going to stay it. I'm going to kill somebody. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] Okay, do we know she's a Tanner? No. Okay, I swap these two. But you know. Which is really like fucking with me. So I think we can adjust it. I kind of think that she was the Tanner and that he was the werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] Do we know she's a Tanner? [SPEAKER_02] kill her. Like I think she's now our best bet. [SPEAKER_02] No, I think it's Justin. I mean, he's a drug bee. I have a 30- [SPEAKER_01] I mean he's a grumpy. I have a 33% chance of assuming that there's only one wearable from there. Yeah. I have a 66% chance of being good. So Julie, were you actually the Tanner? Because Mitch said he switched you into Mike. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] You switched me a mic? Yes. [SPEAKER_02] You heard his line? No. If you- [SPEAKER_01] Please switch me in, Mike. So he's a Tanner. Probably want to kill me now if he was a werewolf. It's what I was doing. [SPEAKER_00] Because you probably want to kill me now. [SPEAKER_02] for you? [SPEAKER_02] I was the robber. [SPEAKER_01] I'm killing somebody just a wait [SPEAKER_02] I think we kill I was the robber who you if you were the Tanner then I'm now the tank It's either I think it's Justin. No, I'm no [SPEAKER_01] I went, okay, fine, you just want me to fast up? Yeah. That's all you, okay, I, when I was awake, I saw the Tanner card. Okay, we have to follow everybody. I'm killing you, League. You're killing? [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] "}

[SPEAKER_02] So one of you guys are lying. [SPEAKER_00] Because I robbed him. [SPEAKER_02] And I saw the treble maker. Well, I can confirm. [SPEAKER_01] \u0432\u0430\u043d [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Can you tell us one of the people you switched? Cause I think the person who's taken my role, A, wasn't you. [SPEAKER_02] So one of these two. [SPEAKER_02] And then I think they are aware of. [SPEAKER_01] I know. [SPEAKER_02] because I can't think of another reason, unless they're tattering right now. [SPEAKER_01] unless they're there's tannering right now. You switched me with somebody. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, well... [SPEAKER_02] So do you still want to say that you're the steer? [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, okay, I started with that and I looked at the card. [SPEAKER_02] Okay. [SPEAKER_01] Put the card in the template. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] aerosol mode. [SPEAKER_01] arios [SPEAKER_01] So who did you switch me with? Or do you switch from a middle? [SPEAKER_02] No, you wouldn't have. [SPEAKER_01] No, I had to switch to people. Oh, to people. [SPEAKER_02] I can't believe this work... [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] Okay. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] So then... [SPEAKER_02] Mike's the werewolf. No, I'm not the werewolf. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I did you rub Justin and he got and saw that you got troublemaker. I did switch. [SPEAKER_00] upbeat music [SPEAKER_01] Mike and Julie. [SPEAKER_01] Okay so now he... [SPEAKER_02] So this happened. Okay. Yeah, that would happen after my robs, so. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_01] And we're still this here. [SPEAKER_02] end experience still [SPEAKER_01] One word. [SPEAKER_02] You're still saying that you were the seer since you're not it anymore. [SPEAKER_01] I mean, I guess now in the trouble maker if they were to win. [SPEAKER_02] If they're original rock. [SPEAKER_01] My original yeah, I'm still saying yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, holy shit [SPEAKER_02] Okay. [SPEAKER_02] Holy shit. So what were you, Mitch? How was the troublemaker? [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] That's why. [SPEAKER_01] We have- That is the light. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, why is that- [SPEAKER_02] That is the lie. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why is that my surname? No, no. I didn't even wore the tanner. What did my, what did my play do? Oh shit. The robber. Oh yeah, that's what it was. [SPEAKER_00] We didn't make that. [SPEAKER_01] I didn't even wore the tanner. What did my- what did my- [SPEAKER_02] You know? No. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I don't know what to do because I think Mitch might be the Tanner. I think he might be the Tanner too. [SPEAKER_00] I don't know what to do because I think Mitch might be the Tanner. I think he- [SPEAKER_01] Is it just me or your ass is palm swan? My question is why So you both are completely declaring your titles like Yeah, I'm pretty fine. Okay, so that okay cuz I was the troll maker and I switched some people around And he said that we switch [SPEAKER_02] Is it just me or you guys as palms would? My? My? My? [SPEAKER_02] And he said that we switched so and you still said you were the sears, so I still believe you were the sear. What was your guys? [SPEAKER_01] What did you guys be upset if I told you in Jule do was not actually one of the people I switched? [SPEAKER_01] Is this not fine? [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] Oh, okay, here's the tan. [SPEAKER_01] So you didn't switch that? Yeah. So I'm the seer. I didn't switch anybody. You didn't switch anybody? No. [SPEAKER_00] So you can watch that. Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] I didn't switch anybody. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] No. [SPEAKER_02] Well, it turns out on the camera. Actually, I was really wondering what I was doing. I really went wrong. I'm okay with what. I'm really waiting to fuck it out. You could tell me. But if he doesn't know, I used to always do this. If... [SPEAKER_01] I really want to do a great way out the rock. [SPEAKER_01] But if he doesn't go, he still loses. If you're saying you were the rubber and didn't do it, it was just trouble making it into a chandelier, buddy. Oh, and you were the rubber. OK. I robbed from him. I confirmed he's the rubber. So if Mitch is the werewolf, if he's the Tanner, if he's the Tanner, he has to be the one. But if we kill him, he's also put him in the drunk, and he's just playing one of those things. That also communicates. This is what's in the center, right now. I mean, if he was the drug, that's what's in the center. I think we just don't kill Mitchell. If he's the werewolf, that's bad. The. Yeah, we're not killing anyone. We're still voting the left. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] I'm not going to wait for it. Singer. [SPEAKER_02] I was last. [SPEAKER_00] I robbed from him. I confirmed he's the wherewolf. [SPEAKER_00] I think this is... [SPEAKER_02] he has the video but if we can also put him in the drunk [SPEAKER_00] This is what [SPEAKER_02] in the center right now. [SPEAKER_02] I think we just- [SPEAKER_00] We just... [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] If he's a wear-off, he'll definitely kill somebody."}

No, I know, I don't drink. Like I said, canvass of God. [SPEAKER_01] I don't drink like I said can't [SPEAKER_02] so... [SPEAKER_00] Believe it or not, believe it or not. I know it's crazy. I know it's crazy. But I was legitimately the seer this time. Okay, if you were the seer, and when I looked, he was the drunk. [SPEAKER_02] I know it's crazy. I know it's for time. I would've lived here. [SPEAKER_02] Okay, if you were to see the window. [SPEAKER_01] Interesting. Mike, what were you? I was one of these two. [SPEAKER_01] Well, okay. [SPEAKER_00] So if you're not claiming that I can't anymore than you, I was also one of these. [SPEAKER_01] I was also one of these two, so whichever one you choose, choose fucking wisely. You're kidding me. [SPEAKER_00] I don't know you [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I better not lie, right? So... [SPEAKER_00] So when one of the drunk they have to switch with the middle, right? Yeah, yes. Okay. So I mean... [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, yes. Okay. So randomly they don't get a look so they don't know who they are. [SPEAKER_01] Are you okay with that's what you- [SPEAKER_00] I am one of these three things. [SPEAKER_01] These horrible, horrible things are it. My guys can't- [SPEAKER_00] Alright, why can't judge me for my addiction? [SPEAKER_00] Ok! [SPEAKER_00] Okay, so if someone's a trollmaker then did any switching happening happen? Can anyone confirm that? Yeah, I can confirm. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I can prefer that switching happened. [SPEAKER_00] What was switched? [SPEAKER_00] What, your friends are means to kill. He is the odd men here. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, we guys ownieten. [SPEAKER_01] order of it. [SPEAKER_00] It goes Robert so I run and then you look [SPEAKER_01] I run and then you're so you [SPEAKER_02] And then you look at drunk and then you rob and then I trouble make [SPEAKER_02] And we're getting drunk. [SPEAKER_00] and then he dropped finally with something in here. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. So whatever he has, he has because he was last. I was obviously, did you tell me from the beginning? Um. [SPEAKER_00] Obviously, did you tell me from the beginning? [SPEAKER_00] Why would you be there? [SPEAKER_01] Bye. [SPEAKER_02] Bye. [SPEAKER_00] I can't hear you, sir. [SPEAKER_02] I, I, I trouble make Justin and Julie. [SPEAKER_00] Here it is! [SPEAKER_02] You trouble make a trouble make a trouble. Oh, you But perhaps I can be the director. No, no, no, yeah, yeah, but he still does the switching after he's last, right? So [SPEAKER_00] But perhaps I could get the drone. No, no, no. Yeah, you know. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Right, so I was never the drunk. What? [SPEAKER_00] Tanner, he's totally Tannering right now. He's the Tanner now? But I swear to God I saw a drum. Oh did you? Yeah! Oh sorry, at the beginning. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Oh, did you? Yeah! Sorry, at the beginning. Yeah, I can't comfort a her story, by the way. Totally. [SPEAKER_00] to trust them because I was the right one actually. Well I trust. So would it then be this now? Wouldn't it be this? Yes. Because he didn't trade it. [SPEAKER_01] because I was the wrong [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I do actually. Why, just, it's literally... It's literally... [SPEAKER_02] Yes, because he didn't try to when I chose the right one he didn't try to fake me out on Okay, so you saw dry [SPEAKER_01] I don't know. Kissey, you saw a drunk? Well, I think that... [SPEAKER_01] we just roll [SPEAKER_02] Just Justin. Because this is what's in the center if he was the drunk. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] So we got a 66% chance of winning. Why? [SPEAKER_00] Why are you not claiming that you're the drunk? Well, because I was the drunk and there's nothing I can do. I literally die to odds or I win to odds. He's got a good buddy. That's a shame. That's hard. So, I think it's one of you guys can easily be lying. None of you are lying. Yeah, I'm just... Mike's where I get shit. [SPEAKER_01] What the fuck is that voice? [SPEAKER_01] He's got a lot of money in possession. [SPEAKER_01] So give it a thing as one of you guys can... [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I'm just Mike's where I get yeah, Mike's story isn't checked [SPEAKER_02] Although I think my story is checked because when I had the two I chose the troll maker and it was... I mean it was a 50-50 shot technically. I mean yes, yes. If I was lying. That's something. It's something. [SPEAKER_01] It has something. [SPEAKER_01] You didn't wait for me to do it or anything. No. Who did you trouble make? I- [SPEAKER_02] these two. Oh so now I'm ready to draw. So really she's [SPEAKER_01] So really she's the risky one. No, no, no, no, I still do the drunk action. She just- She just doesn't actually like it. [SPEAKER_00] No, I still do this. [SPEAKER_02] it was written actually them. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] I mean, I think just, I think this game comes down to luck. And I think we just vote Justin. And it's 66% chance we win it, but I just... What did... [SPEAKER_00] I just think what if they're two werewolves that means that we're just completely I mean I feel like it's more likely these two are werewolves because they're the one confirming each other's stories yeah that's also sure I mean unless my seer was switched [SPEAKER_02] I'm here, I feel it. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, that's also sure I mean [SPEAKER_00] to someone else. I would be completely oblivious to it. We have five seconds to vote. Vote in Justin. Yeah. Okay. Rest in peace, guys. I don't know. [SPEAKER_02] I would be if I was a world [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] "}

Yeah. If you had a... I got a... I got a... Do rail! [SPEAKER_00] I got it, I got it. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, all right You will know you guys because you guys were talking about the sound stuff when we're saying as a joke because you guys were wasting time Right, I think that you were wearables, but we know that's not the case. That's a good that's a good [SPEAKER_01] I think as you guys are talking about the sounds. [SPEAKER_01] Right. But we know that's not the case. That's a good strategy. We can just keep talking about this. We can just keep talking about this. Justin's actually employing that strategy right now as one of the two werewolves. Yeah. So knowing other people as the werewolves. So I don't reveal 40 seconds in. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Yeah [SPEAKER_00] I saw something bad just kidding off the revealer [SPEAKER_00] I wish I got some rules. Who is the revealer? [SPEAKER_01] Who is the reviewer? [SPEAKER_00] Is there a revealer? [SPEAKER_01] No. [SPEAKER_01] I guess. Hey, that's another way of starting the game. We never do that. We ask people to tell us what they are. But now we can do it. What are you? Oh, I don't want to say. I think it's the world. I mean, the Insomniac. Oh. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Did you wake up as what you were? I'm gonna hold off on that info. I don't think he did. Do we have anything that's put just things that we have a trouble maker? Oh yeah. [SPEAKER_00] I didn't think he did. [SPEAKER_00] So it could have been so many. It's not a same insomnia. I'm gonna say that I am the rest of these ones. So be- I- I can guarantee you I'm one of the one of the best days to- Except Laura's days too. [SPEAKER_01] So it could have been just now saying Insomnia. [SPEAKER_01] S [SPEAKER_01] Except for his days too. [SPEAKER_00] But you could be one of the worlds that's not camping. [SPEAKER_01] I can't be both of them. Definitely not that one. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] I'd nod the tanner either. No. Just tanner straight out. [SPEAKER_00] Oh, no, is that take a tan or a... [SPEAKER_00] Alright, what about the other side of the table? Because I've actually put some rules down in front of my card to show that I'm getting it. Sure. There we go. Pass the trial. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah sure. Great. Nice. Pass the trial. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, so I'm very sure we have a wearable here. Oh, yes. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_00] Oh, yes, I think we definitely have two. [SPEAKER_01] I think we yeah [SPEAKER_01] I think Caitlin's a wortler. Because she's held off so long. Okay, she's right. [SPEAKER_00] That's a dangerous game for everyone. So do we have no good people? I mean, I'm one of those guys. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I'm good. Okay, what did you see? What do you mean what did I see? Are you still at the inside of your neck? If you guys reveal that one of you are a troublemaker, that would explain something. You guys haven't given me anything to work with here yet. [SPEAKER_00] Just there, yeah? [SPEAKER_00] Helene something good. [SPEAKER_00] acey \uac10\uc0ac\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4 [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, well then who's the troublemaker that's the only way I can switch What then you must be the troublemaker if you're not a troublemaker use a troublemaker. I don't think you [SPEAKER_00] really where I can switch. [SPEAKER_00] You're not a trope maker, you're using trope maker. I don't like you. You're a trope maker. [SPEAKER_01] Maybe I'm a troll later. I'm the troll mo maker. Oh, see. [SPEAKER_01] What did you switch? I switched... nobody. [SPEAKER_01] So now you know I woke up at the incident on the act. Okay, well... The spaminite is officially lost in time. I don't know! [SPEAKER_00] That night has gone crazy. I'm gonna say that I was aware of what we started. [SPEAKER_01] Looks good leg. I like that. You're okay. I like that leg [SPEAKER_00] I like that layer. Okay. [SPEAKER_00] Because I feel like Mitch wants to start seeing some action and I'll commit to this action. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I'll commit just to making it up. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, I'll confirm that she was not a werewolf with me. So she is a Tanner attempting suicide. Do you want it? [SPEAKER_01] Do you want to defend yourself against this? Where you perhaps the werewolf? [SPEAKER_01] and he's lying. [SPEAKER_00] \uc548\ub155 \uc5b4\ub5bb\uac8cvida? [SPEAKER_01] Plead and look, man. What a strategy. That actually is an interesting strategy. [SPEAKER_00] there [SPEAKER_00] Interesting strategy. You have the right to an attorney. [SPEAKER_01] If you cannot afford one one will be provided for you. So why what did you see in the middle? I saw a revealer [SPEAKER_00] So my body's in the middle. [SPEAKER_00] Oh, that makes sense because now I'm in the reveal. [SPEAKER_01] And there's no drunk so it doesn't really matter where... [SPEAKER_00] So then did you guys think it's on here? [SPEAKER_01] Yes. [SPEAKER_01] So you're the werewolf, but he might be the Tanner and you need to save us. Miss Werewolf. I have a feeling she's the werewolf and he's a Tanner. This is my guess. Oh, he could be a Tanner. I think he recognized that there is no troublemaker. No, I don't. No wait, that's opposite logic I'm using here. [SPEAKER_00] I think he- [SPEAKER_01] I blew it out there because I was expecting my [SPEAKER_00] I would know there because I was expecting Mike to be a troublemaker because of the way he was talking. [SPEAKER_00] You can kill Kaylen if you want to lose. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] I think that's just the bottom line. She's a terrible girl. I think she might be the turner too. [SPEAKER_01] So everything's pointing to Justin. Is it possible he did a good job at being Tanner? It's possible. What would he do these moves? How? Okay, let's speak up. You have more than anyone here. [SPEAKER_00] Er darf das neu. [SPEAKER_01] kobo [SPEAKER_01] Investorial [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Played his glasses off the... [SPEAKER_01] I can be proud of this. [SPEAKER_00] I may have made a bad decision. [SPEAKER_00] time [SPEAKER_01] \u05d4\u05d9 \u062c\u0628 \u062c\u062f \u062c\u0646 \u06af\u0bc1\u06cc\u0646semble [SPEAKER_00] "}

I don't like it. You don't like it? It's quiet? Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] It is offered the cry of the school. It's so amazing. It's so amazing. [SPEAKER_00] Insomnia goes her eyes so we can't make a cure. [SPEAKER_00] I'm gonna kill you, Zostak. [SPEAKER_00] Review, player. Who? To your hand. You may turn any other players... [SPEAKER_00] Music [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] music but lower? Oh my god yeah please. So what's everyone thinking? [SPEAKER_00] That's a card. [SPEAKER_00] I have loads of information. Let's kick. [SPEAKER_00] All right. [SPEAKER_00] I was gonna hold that load. I was gonna say he's probably... The Tanner. Or he's the insomniac. He didn't wake up his insomniac. Or he's the wearable. I won't wearable. And he looked at it. What are you guys? Okay? You just threw every fucking chip on my car. Well, there was two left. [SPEAKER_01] Is that loads? [SPEAKER_01] Let's stand here. [SPEAKER_01] you [SPEAKER_00] You're definitely not the trouble maker. They have no information. I'll take the trouble maker for now. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Okay. [SPEAKER_00] That's fun, excited? Yeah! [SPEAKER_00] I did not have you, then I have my eyes too early or too late and I missed you going to wear waltz with me. Either you're the Tanner or I'm the Tanner. That's true. I just thought, I'm not even going to reveal anything from this event. Yeah, why don't you, Mother of Fucker? We've all revealed. I've seen you reveal it. [SPEAKER_01] one of these. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, it's probably the redone of these two. Nice. [SPEAKER_00] Revealer has more information, I think. [SPEAKER_00] He says he's low so I'm just playing off. Yeah, that's what I thought. When he said that, the typewriter, he was the revealer. [SPEAKER_01] \u54ce\u5440,\u90a3\u51fa\u6765\u5462 [SPEAKER_00] which means that he saw either. [SPEAKER_00] a Tanner or a werewolf so he looked at either me or Caitlin because we were one of the two. [SPEAKER_00] Right. [SPEAKER_00] Do you want to say if you looked at me or Caitlin? Yes. [SPEAKER_00] Alright, which one? [SPEAKER_00] as far as I'm going right now. [SPEAKER_00] Which is which? [SPEAKER_00] So that means he's the revealer. Yeah. Yeah. So he's the front of the series though. Yeah, who did you switch? Malafaka? Did you switch me in Caitlin? No. Oh good. I switched you in Mitch. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] Boom, it shows our rule. [SPEAKER_00] \u0647 Circe. ils [SPEAKER_00] I know for a fact... [SPEAKER_00] that might as well. [SPEAKER_00] I don't want 100% of the people I live in. [SPEAKER_00] So that means... So why are you lying, Mike? The revealer might like to cause chaos. [SPEAKER_01] So why do you lie? [SPEAKER_00] He could have been like, he switched to mean Zitlin and we both actually are wearables. So that means that Mitchell looked at your card and did not see reveal it. Did not see reveal it, that checks out because then reveal it was going to face up and he would have been like... What? [SPEAKER_01] Also. Get angry here in the bathroom. Let's see what we can do. Starts with the facto corruption. All women do Razar, but the false chaos is the one thing why we should seek them as tender, official, no threat and it is at the edges of a fake before the doctor said the law [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] You imagine going to someone else's side? I don't see you just seeing you inside. Can I just... No! Okay, so then why would make live on being a trouble maker? I think you're just trying to catch someone else in the line. That makes sense, and there's someone else in the line. [SPEAKER_01] I think he's just trying to catch [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] I don't know, enough for a moment. But I don't understand how he was could be lying. The troublemaker of May? Yes. Yes. So he didn't switch the buttons. So he was just lying. And that's what he's referring to, but somebody else. He's the world follow-up. He just said, Mike is lying. Maybe he's the sereness troublemaker in the center. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Yes, yes, yeah, and sayingAfter he did this with me, and then he zam years [SPEAKER_00] We need to help her though. I just want to guess the information you can go. I'm waiting for one of you guys to trip up and then catch you. I think maybe Justin's actually a Tanner. [SPEAKER_01] I just want to guess the information you can go. [SPEAKER_00] Wouldn't that be a nightmare? I don't know what to do right now. Do we have two wearables in a tanner again? Wouldn't that suck? [SPEAKER_00] So what's happening is that you run it against two werewolves in a tanner. [SPEAKER_00] Maybe it's YouTube The Wild World. It's really upset right now. [SPEAKER_00] No, the Caitlin's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_00] Fuck me, I don't know. There's too much. What do you mean? I've been burdened with too much information that I'm so scared. Who are you trying to entrap? [SPEAKER_01] I've been- [SPEAKER_00] Anyone? Yeah, you are. Anyone? [SPEAKER_00] Anyone who do you know I suspect here? I'm bleeding the fifth I'm bleeding the fifth I know too [SPEAKER_00] That's it. [SPEAKER_00] I'm definitely the troll maker. [SPEAKER_00] I don't know what to do here. I'm definitely the troublemaker and I don't think much. We just have to vote in unison. It doesn't matter who. It's true. Just tell me I'm a weirdo for Mike. I'm a weirdo. Tell me who to vote for. If you saw me, you saw a weirdo for it. [SPEAKER_01] I'm definitely... [SPEAKER_01] Bye, wait just a minute. [SPEAKER_01] Tell me I'm leaving for my own werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] Bye. [SPEAKER_00] You know you looked at one of these two you need to tell me Go Mike Mike you're 25 seconds And this finger goes to that name so what's happening right now is Mitchell doesn't trust Mike and he's trying to see if Which one is the other werewolf because I think Mike might be a werewolf. That's what's probably happening right now I can promise you I was the only werewolf. I didn't switch anybody. I saw a fucking apprentice here in the center And it was a great happy magical puss. It's chaos might tell me name [SPEAKER_01] You need to tell me you know what I'm talking about. [SPEAKER_01] 5 seconds. You look at me. You need to tell me which one you will you tell me in [SPEAKER_01] So what's happening right now? [SPEAKER_01] I didn't switch anybody. [SPEAKER_01] so [SPEAKER_01] Till..."}

[SPEAKER_00] I was a robber. [SPEAKER_00] Don't you dare confront my story. [SPEAKER_00] I can come from one of the stories out here. [SPEAKER_00] because of the Tanner one, because that's a weird story to confirm. But with the reason why... [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I think he's a Tanner. He's like a firming because it's not what I claimed. It's because he took it. [SPEAKER_00] That's like a- [SPEAKER_00] is because he took it with confidence right out of the gate. He took my character with confidence and that point straight to Tanner to me. JAR! [SPEAKER_01] or immediately conflicting somebody as soon as it was picked. Yeah. Do you like... [SPEAKER_00] tables, lectern. United or the truth? [SPEAKER_00] of which one of us was Robert. Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_00] Not as fun. Okay, I can confirm Justin's story and I'm pretty sure he's a ten. [SPEAKER_01] Which one did you peck jelly? Which one did you peck? [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] I mean, we're fucking hell everybody just so everyone knows we could stay with this and then the fuck and then what guys what happens if we stay here? No the crazy thing is I look at one of you mother fuckers [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] So this is confirmed. [SPEAKER_00] And if you notice, your cards aren't up. [SPEAKER_00] I can confirm that he isn't a revealer, so he is not lying. So this is telling me, I think your Tanner, your where will fear revealer on the Robert. I'm now the revealer. [SPEAKER_01] Wait a second. [SPEAKER_00] You're aware of it, man? John, I know the craziest thing. I was actually the drunk. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Sorry, so we have here. There are two liars here, Paul. [SPEAKER_01] Sorry, so we have hand-root liars. [SPEAKER_00] uh... no i can confirm the story i can confirm that you were the russian i'm having major deja vu i was the drunk okay except he wasn't i can confirm the original story [SPEAKER_00] And I know you weren't the rotter. Alright, so here's an on-thing in half of Paul. Unfortunately. [SPEAKER_00] Tanner werewolf. That's not thinking it's happening right now. No, no, no, no, no. And you said you were the robber, right? [SPEAKER_01] Who\u3041, she's insane she'll see via porn, Mom. [SPEAKER_00] I think it's going hard though. I think I think I think just started a whats again do not vote for me but I said that last night was a tanner uh he's lying for sure 100% um I don't know what's going on over there because I did see a revealer he does not see revealer 100% saw a revealer I know you're lying can I'm gonna go on a main [SPEAKER_01] It just started to get better. [SPEAKER_01] I was 100% so... [SPEAKER_01] Okay, I'm gonna go on a major fucking limb right now. The other oh shit. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, I'm just gonna have to, this is what I think is happening right now. This is what I think this is. You're this. [SPEAKER_01] You are this. What? For sure. And I know what I'm like the whole time. And so am I. No, that's what you are now. You were the drunk. What was that? I believe you were the drunk. If you, okay, okay, I'll full, full limb, full limb. I don't think she was. I was so aware, well, this is the other aware, well. So if you pick that card, that's what you are. I think Justin revealed you. If you are the Tanner, which I think you are, can we all just vote for Justin? Because you're not going to win. I'm not the Tanner. [SPEAKER_00] I don't know am I like the whole time I'm so am I [SPEAKER_00] What was that? [SPEAKER_00] Full limb full image. I don't think she was. [SPEAKER_00] I'm not the Tanner. So there's one loophole in your story. Because I want you to die. That's the loophole. So we all vote for Paul. [SPEAKER_01] S\u00f6nd\u00fc bidr\u00fc, leisure mi tamam nedir ! [SPEAKER_00] Wulfer- Stephanie [SPEAKER_00] I'm not coming, I can vote for Paul, man. I'm gonna vote for Julie because she claimed my role. That's the bottom line. I'm voting for Paul. Mitch, I think that she might be the Tanner and I think Paul's a way to roll. [SPEAKER_00] I'm voting. I'm going to vote for you then. [SPEAKER_01] bj will take only [SPEAKER_00] I'm on it for you or June. Who did you go to the animal where they came from? I'm on it for Paul. I was the drunk. So, do you think we went for a lift? I think we went for the werewolf. We went for the werewolf. [SPEAKER_00] He said he's your teammate, you should vote for Mitchell or vote for me. [SPEAKER_01] He said he's your team. [SPEAKER_00] Oh, yeah, I'm gonna... He's gonna be wearing a drunk Julie. I've on it for a bit. [SPEAKER_01] He's from you were the drunk Julie. I got it for baseball. You were the. I'm from Mitchell.

That's why I chose this. So I'm doing speak up. Go right away. And we're all sits in the center. And we're all sitting in the center. And I wanted to know what they saw in the center. [SPEAKER_01] because I wanted to know. [SPEAKER_02] Interesting, but I was the drunk. It's almost a fuse. Maybe me and the Tanner. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] owa\u0142 he he [SPEAKER_01] me isn't\u6cb9, you may instead [SPEAKER_02] wants to get picked up.

[SPEAKER_00] And now you're... [SPEAKER_02] and now you're a world, and I'm a world of hope. Okay, this is Tannery. [SPEAKER_01] I believe it. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, that could be tannering. [SPEAKER_01] And if Paul's the drunk, that means he's one of these things, which skews on the side of... [SPEAKER_01] Uh oh. [SPEAKER_01] Excuse me. I actually did look at me or what you say where yeah, I am 100% what I say. I did look at me And she was aware of who I like that I switch to YouTube [SPEAKER_02] Excuse me. It's my producer. I actually did live in May or what you say. I am 100%. [SPEAKER_00] you see where. [SPEAKER_02] I did look at Megan's, she was a wearable. [SPEAKER_01] You're such a dummy, me, me, me, me, me. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] I mean, I didn't actually start as a wear walk. [SPEAKER_01] what your start is. [SPEAKER_01] So same, next line. [SPEAKER_00] What if Mike started work? No, I'm not... [SPEAKER_01] What? No, I'm not saying makes line. How does... [SPEAKER_01] Nein, Simon, das ist... [SPEAKER_02] so you sayingriages CHAiono -... GO tear\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77\u8b77 [SPEAKER_01] Uh, what are they? What was that? So Megan said she robbed from you and Mike looked at Megan and said she was aware of wolf. After the robbery occurred? Yeah, the one that was going to go last. Oh, yeah, that didn't happen. So what were you? [SPEAKER_00] so Megan said you robbed her [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, but that didn't happen. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] I was the seer. [SPEAKER_01] God's damage is fucking horrible. [SPEAKER_01] It's not so curious about what was happening with Paul over there. Alright, so then what did you see? [SPEAKER_00] Alright. [SPEAKER_01] Actually, first Paul, which one did you switch with? [SPEAKER_02] Why do I have to go first? Yes. Does it matter? Do we know what's in it? Here's the theory that told me. [SPEAKER_01] You're gonna tell me what was in the center without pointing if you looked at the center. Did you look in the center? [SPEAKER_01] No, it's not like this. Well, Hennessy doesn't look in the center when there's a drunk in the game. [SPEAKER_02] kind of see or doesn't look in the center with her. [SPEAKER_02] I didn't look at the center. [SPEAKER_01] I didn't look at the center. That's true, she looked at you. So what the fuck is she doing over here? [SPEAKER_01] I'm a wearable. That's what we're doing. Just like Tanner, right? Was she the Tanner? [SPEAKER_00] Gentlemen do you?encryrent? Ling on [SPEAKER_01] Because I- Oh, then you know! The maximum tan of both of us. I do know. Robert switches before the trouble makes me. Yes. [SPEAKER_02] You know. The rappers. Tannin' for the stage. I do. [SPEAKER_02] Yes, I just I [SPEAKER_01] She was just a tanner and she's just like playing with us. I mean I was... [SPEAKER_02] I mean I was lying about her but I wanted to see what she said and she didn't say that you switched Yeah, you're the tenor [SPEAKER_01] Justin, you say that you switched. Wait, you're a lie to me too? Okay, you're the... [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] So Mitch, read the tanner when you went to bed? No. Did you want to die? No. Did you learn to... [SPEAKER_02] It's one time, but I don't think Megan was the rubber from the beginning. I think Justin might be a rubber with Megan [SPEAKER_01] I think just... [SPEAKER_01] I am 100% the fucking trouble maker. 100%. I don't even have the will to fight it because this town's getting manipulative. I don't even know because I didn't start off as the world, so I'm not even sure if there's anyone else. [SPEAKER_00] I even know [SPEAKER_01] I think, have you didn't start as the war will? No, because I swapped. I was the robber. [SPEAKER_02] I think he didn't start as the werewolf. No, because I swapped him. [SPEAKER_02] She said she was the robber, I don't think she was, I think she was the tenor from the beginning. [SPEAKER_01] and you saw the town. [SPEAKER_02] I saw the tenor. I flipped it back down. [SPEAKER_01] flip them back down. I think I think you saw the Tanner. Yeah. You were definitely a Robert. You're a Robert. Robert. [SPEAKER_02] Did you actually switch? Yes, I did. [SPEAKER_01] Yes, that's what you're saying. [SPEAKER_01] Wait, who would it be? In my switch, you two. What's it? Okay. Okay. No, no. I think, I think, I think there's... [SPEAKER_02] Okay, it might be much too... [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] No, no, no. I think... [SPEAKER_02] two were also in the center. Why don't you trust me? I feel like Mike's lying. Why? Can we just trust me? That Mike's lying for sure. No, no, no. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I feel like Mike's lying. Mike's lying. [SPEAKER_00] Can we just... [SPEAKER_01] Trust me, that makes lying for sure. No, it's not me, why? But why are you trying to be the werewolf? I'm into, because I don't, who the fuck do we vote for? I think Paul, because- I'm voting for Megan. I'm voting for Paul, because Drunkie is the most likely- Why? I'm into voting for Mike, because it's a little fishy here. I don't know. I think Megan's a fan. Mike's gonna be the Tanner. Why am I putting him in stuff on me? I'm not putting stuff on me. I'm killing Paul. Paul? Yeah. Cause he's the best safe bet. I'll follow Paul. [SPEAKER_02] I think Paul, because- I voted for me, Agam. I'm voting for Paul because drunken is the most likely to become a- [SPEAKER_00] Magic light even... [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Why am I putting stuff on me? I'm not putting stuff on me. [SPEAKER_02] He's the best ace bet! [SPEAKER_02] I mean you were the drunk. Sure, let's vote, Paul.

I don't matter this game [SPEAKER_01] Just do that, okay. [SPEAKER_00] For reals this time guys, like honestly. [SPEAKER_01] So do we have a sear that looked at two in the center? [SPEAKER_00] I mean, I was gonna look at Mitch, but then you looked at you, so I looked at you. [SPEAKER_00] I was both of these werewolves. [SPEAKER_00] Oh damn it. [SPEAKER_02] All the wearables. Oh, you were this year. I was this year. So what'd you see? [SPEAKER_02] I'm gonna hold off on that for a bit. Can you say if you look at a player? It was center this time. [SPEAKER_00] Can you say you look at a player player? It was sentient. [SPEAKER_01] this time. Which is the correct choice in my opinion that the trunk is in the case. [SPEAKER_02] You taught me last game. I was like, oh no, I was lying that last game. [SPEAKER_00] I forgot I was lying. I'm lying again, I didn't believe it. It's hard to get my story straight. Do we want to guess out of these four, which one I am? Definitely trouble maker always. [SPEAKER_02] I'm like again, I didn't drink. [SPEAKER_01] Definitely trouble maker always. [SPEAKER_00] Barrwing [SPEAKER_02] So we just let you. So he's gonna tell us the answer. And it's not true. It's not true. It's not true. It's not true. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] And it's not true. It's not true. [SPEAKER_00] No, it's around it's no on round three. I say what the truth was very first [SPEAKER_01] You did not know the rules of Paul? Yeah, there's no- Forget this out, yeah. Oh my goodness, he's stealing the wrong- He's stealing the wrong- Oh, you're still from me, didn't you? No, I didn't. Oh, thanks. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, yeah, there's no forget this out. Yeah, nice [SPEAKER_00] No identity. [SPEAKER_00] I will tell you a total honesty about my trouble making. I switched diagonal. So either switch making or I switch midj-indestine. That's interesting. Okay. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Not looking good for you, Meg. It's really good. [SPEAKER_00] Um, so [SPEAKER_02] So more than likely. [SPEAKER_02] Well, I mean, I can't say so much. Did you see what did you see? I did see which one do you look at? One werewolf in the center. One werewolf in the center. [SPEAKER_01] So much that you said what did you say? I did. [SPEAKER_00] I didn't see which one you look at. [SPEAKER_00] I saw some of the [SPEAKER_00] Let's see your order there. So I can confirm she was the drunk at one point. She might not be now. [SPEAKER_02] Let's see what's in there. [SPEAKER_01] So I can confirm she was the drunk at one point. [SPEAKER_01] I mean I want you guys to kill me. So, no. I'm not doing a good job at my. [SPEAKER_01] I don't care, I'm... [SPEAKER_02] I feel like Justin just playing this game weird. Ha ha. [SPEAKER_01] I had the soul sucked out of me in the first place. I would say I would say I would think in rid of the revealer for next round would be good. [SPEAKER_02] I would say [SPEAKER_01] Well, the reveal didn't happen. [SPEAKER_00] Mitch, you didn't see anything that anyone is planning to be in the center? [SPEAKER_01] So more than like me in the center that and then that's so I'm something still in the middle [SPEAKER_02] You're still something from the middle. [SPEAKER_00] You should just tell me from the middle. [SPEAKER_01] Okay. [SPEAKER_02] Which one did you take from the middle Megan? [SPEAKER_02] I thought I'd think I swapped the closest two. But I think... [SPEAKER_01] But I think as well. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] But I think Justin was a railroad. If you woke up alone as a werewolf, and now he just doesn't want to talk to anybody. I saw a werewolf in the center. Yeah, that's exactly what he said. [SPEAKER_00] I saw a word. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, that's exactly what happens. That's not what happens. [SPEAKER_02] I can, I think I can safely say with a lot of info that there was a wearable fear and that is the one she took for what that's worth. [SPEAKER_01] There was, you saw two, you see two in the center? Or just one? I can't remember. Oh, I mean, you can really throw me a bone and just say you saw two werewolves because I'm the fucking Tanner. And this is just my luck. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_00] I think you're the werewolf. [SPEAKER_02] Can anyone corroborate me? I don't... Can't worry... [SPEAKER_00] Can you, no, I stole, I stole. Just if you promise that you're the tenor. Yes. I don't believe him. If you, if you believe you are the tenor and you're still a tenor, I will, I will kill you. If you're telling me the truth. If you promise you're telling me the truth right now. What? Like I will vote for you at the end. If, if, if knowing what I know, I know that you are still. Should you pick, [SPEAKER_02] it'll hold up and ID. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Gosh. [SPEAKER_01] So you picked which one in the center, Megan? Okay, so you didn't switch means what you're saying? So this is... [SPEAKER_00] there yeah that's for sure saw where we'll [SPEAKER_01] for sure saw where we'll [SPEAKER_02] Yes, 100% there was a wormhole here and she's a drunk and she's a bit [SPEAKER_00] Okay, but is there another where we'll find the table? I suppose. [SPEAKER_01] This is me? [SPEAKER_01] with... So I'm tired. Don't fucking kill Mitchell. I look like you have to kill me, honestly. The way this is playing out. [SPEAKER_00] God bless us. [SPEAKER_02] I don't think he was the Tanner. No, he- I was a Tanner. Switched me. But it doesn't. So don't fucking kill me. [SPEAKER_01] I was now switched me, so don't fucking kill me. It doesn't matter unless there's two werewolves That's the only other thing is if somehow Justin had something that was in the middle [SPEAKER_00] Why are you convincing me to kill you? [SPEAKER_01] because she knows the answer and I don't think so I think I think these [SPEAKER_00] I don't know if the answer... [SPEAKER_02] I think these two were like we're all together or something. I don't, and they're pointing it off. I'm taking. [SPEAKER_01] I know. [SPEAKER_00] pointing it on and taking it. [SPEAKER_00] No, I am inclined to believe Mitchell and if I'm wrong then good job Mitchell. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_00] No, I don't, I don't trust Justin and his head. I think he has some reason. [SPEAKER_02] I thought he had to be naked. I saw where Wolfier she said she was a drug addict. He just don't kill Mitchell because he's a damage scanner. But Mitchell. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, just don't kill Mitchell, but Mitchell's story doesn't can't get [SPEAKER_02] It can't I won't give you that but I mean the only for my always events. Yeah, now he's a Tanner [SPEAKER_01] But now he's a tenner. So... [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I think we've over made it. Time is up! [SPEAKER_01] "}

So we have Mike Sengis, who are the other Mitch Sengis, who was the drunk turned to robber. Well, Kaelin actually said you were the drunk. Yeah, let's just think of the trouble maker Paul Sengis and the Seer. And I only have wherewith wherewith minion Tannin. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_03] So things I look into the Hulk for Justin. No. Is this also interesting because I'm going to tell you right now, I looked at someone's card and I know who the minion is. Sick! No. Okay, we got to talk for a few seconds. When does the seer go? Seer goes first. After I, after the werewolves and the minions. So... [SPEAKER_01] a [SPEAKER_01] When is it? [SPEAKER_00] Neither Mitchell or I. [SPEAKER_03] So I know who started this amazing. So it's one of those two. I was a troublemaker, which is a little bit suspicious. [SPEAKER_00] one of the [SPEAKER_03] and I switched YouTube. [SPEAKER_03] Oh, and what's the word? Do I need a junk first? No, I need a junk after. And I reveal very last. So you saw a minion? No. You saw a wolf. No. I saw a Tanner. Oh, okay. No. What can you tell us who it is? Yeah, it's Mitch.

Well, there's two of us at the table who have the same story. Can you say it's one of us? [SPEAKER_03] What do you mean they have the same story? Because I'm also saying I'm the trouble maker? Ah, it wasn't either of you actually. Spice! Are there any two people that are collaborating each other that? [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_03] or unchecked. Yeah, you too. [SPEAKER_01] hope [SPEAKER_03] I mean, I saw that you were tender, so I can't remember. Checked out that you were a drunk maybe? [SPEAKER_01] I mean I saw that you were 10 [SPEAKER_03] It could just been Tatter from the beginning. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_03] That's true, but if we were together, I wouldn't know he was a kid. Who did you rob? I was robbed. I... Oh, you and the drunk. I flipped it over. I saw the drunk. I was robbered. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] again. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Thank you, Rods. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Oh, you were the drag. [SPEAKER_03] Robert. Robert. Spicy. Super. Which one did you switch it? [SPEAKER_03] I thought you wanted somebody's if you look at somebody's worst of the center. No, it looked as somebody's but I'm still curious I'm gonna answer that because I don't see why yep, I agree with that [SPEAKER_02] Oh, because nobody knows. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, we don't know who you guys, nobody in the center. The werewolves would have been away. [SPEAKER_03] I don't know where I was. Well, if you're on a We're With Funny Morwich, means you were probably the Tanner to start with. No, I'm kidding, I was the seer. Okay, who did you look at? We need to know that information. [SPEAKER_01] Alright, I took a note from one of your exploding pimples and shooting chicks.... [SPEAKER_02] actually did look at turns and you know that's why I was asking. [SPEAKER_03] Alright, which one do you look at? [SPEAKER_03] Because one of them, the Tanner. [SPEAKER_00] He was one of them the Tanner. Sometimes I think Paul is like really unbelievably suspicious and then I remember the Tanner. I am. [SPEAKER_03] I am, you know, I am... But I am also especially... [SPEAKER_01] I am on who specials. Okay, you said who, because you said you're the show host. I was there. [SPEAKER_00] I was actually the seer but I grabbed trouble make a crust. He grabbed it so I just grabbed one [SPEAKER_01] you [SPEAKER_03] Okay. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, that gets hooded. [SPEAKER_00] Yes dude, hmm which one is my down [SPEAKER_00] I listed you in the middle. Ooh, what did you see in the middle? I saw minion and I saw... I can't remember the other one, I'll be honest. I think it was Robert. [SPEAKER_03] Where was the... Where was the minion? [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] for here. Yeah, it was. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, it was. Alicia knows that because she's wearable and she's the only wearable. All right, well, this town is in a deadlock and we're not gonna win. So I'm going to just sit and wait to see what happens when you're in a particular place. Here, let me give you some more information. This one is the minion. [SPEAKER_02] That's interesting. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, so here here let me give you [SPEAKER_03] delicious making both confirmed that and [SPEAKER_00] and these taste have really suspicious and did you actually switch them? I don't know what this one is [SPEAKER_03] And did you actually switch them? I don't know what this one is. Did you switch? It's too. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_03] That doesn't matter, which actually, Mijama fully just tell you, well, I'll tell you that this is a good one. I think Mijama is a word. If this is one that you switched with, that somebody is claiming. And based on the order, okay, it's Micah. [SPEAKER_00] after [SPEAKER_02] Actually, maybe I'm gonna have to only just tell you [SPEAKER_00] You think Mitchell's. [SPEAKER_02] I'll tell you that [SPEAKER_00] This is a good one. If this... [SPEAKER_02] This is the revealer, this is the minion. Oh. [SPEAKER_03] So, let it, the ratio could have been used. I don't think Mike, if he was a revealer, he would out someone as the Tanner. [SPEAKER_02] My name is... [SPEAKER_01] information could have been used. [SPEAKER_01] I don't think so. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_03] Because then that makes it one less person that could possibly be killed if he's a werewolf. I think maybe, I don't know, it makes my- Only 30 seconds left. And that's- [SPEAKER_02] Only 30 seconds left. And that's also way because I don't know how a Lysha knew this was mean, that she literally just guessed. [SPEAKER_03] because it seems to indicate that they're both wearables. [SPEAKER_00] 7 [SPEAKER_00] I know what you're saying. I know what you're saying. I think Mitchell might be aware of all of them. [SPEAKER_03] I know for sure. [SPEAKER_03] I'm not gonna kill Mitchell because if he's a Tanner he deserves it. [SPEAKER_03] No, don't give a shit. I got the notes to vote on. Alicia and Micra definitely both lying. That's what I know. Don't vote for me, I have a word with.

Because I am robbed from her. And I can verify that story. It is a revealing. [SPEAKER_05] Sang \u0443\u0434 [SPEAKER_00] I can bear. [SPEAKER_00] So you said where wolves, I believe Paul, because he said where wolves. [SPEAKER_03] sl. here [SPEAKER_00] He said, he said, he said, I don't know if I've been switched, so I'm not giving up the werewolf yet. So I believe he actually was. Well, it's only been and there's two werewolves. And I know for sure Justin was one of them. And now I'm starting to suspect he was, because he was trying to throw shade off of Justin. Oh my god, no way to show him. [SPEAKER_01] He said, he said, besides the trouble that I do. [SPEAKER_03] Oh no! [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_03] Yeah [SPEAKER_01] So we didn't and there's two animals and [SPEAKER_03] \u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6709\u4e9b suddenly [SPEAKER_02] I tried to put shit on just then. So that means we gotta kill Mike. If I'm the Tanner, where you kill me? That's completely neat. Yeah, Mike is getting weird. Okay, Mike is super weird. Ice in. [SPEAKER_05] I'm just dead. So that means we gotta kill Mike. [SPEAKER_03] ends in the [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, Mike is getting weird. This is like a super weird ice cream. [SPEAKER_05] We're buddies. I switched these two 100% I switched these so [SPEAKER_00] So you swedished. [SPEAKER_02] Shit, I was about wearable friends that I need to protect. I'm just... Mike, let's do this. No. Oh, woo! [SPEAKER_05] I was aware of that didn't happen. You were okay, so you're not the minion. I saw the minion. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] I saw a minute. Remake. You saw what? [SPEAKER_00] I saw Justin's card. It was a wearable. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_05] So then we vote for Paul. [SPEAKER_00] In my site I don't believe you. [SPEAKER_02] I don't believe Mike for a second he's a werewolf. Yeah, I'm kind of in a few. Okay, we, we villagers. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, I'm kind of if you okay we we villagers [SPEAKER_05] villagers we have to get on the same page here none of these three are really goodcarbon stories [SPEAKER_05] so you said these two were the bad So you..... [SPEAKER_02] So you said these two were the bad. So you said you started as a minion? [SPEAKER_00] you [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Then how did you see me as a Tanner? Mike explained that one. Only 30 seconds. So I don't... [SPEAKER_04] Only 30 seconds. [SPEAKER_01] See, I don't believe her as well. I can't remember how I figured this out, but I think we have to vote left because I think both the burbles are in the middle and then it's just the minion and the Tanner. [SPEAKER_01] I think we gotta vote left. [SPEAKER_00] If there is two worlds starting, I don't think they're both. You wouldn't have seen... [SPEAKER_05] You wouldn't have seen... So who are we voting for? 10 seconds back. Is it Mike? I'm like... [SPEAKER_03] So who are we? I brought 10 seconds back. Is it Mike? I'm like, I- I thought we can't. I'm Paul, I'm Justin. It's Paul. I'm voting Mike. It's voting Justin. I'm- [SPEAKER_04] Mike. [SPEAKER_00] Did you probably see it check at\u5068\u738b\u5371 dis heek [SPEAKER_01] I'm voting Mike. I'm actually the Tanner TVH and I think we need to put left. Don't I need to put a village or something? [SPEAKER_05] Don't hide me for a village or something. [SPEAKER_01] 3"}

Okay, now let's start at the beginning. You looked... Have Mitchell. And you saw that Mitchell was actually a werewolf. Cool. All right. Mike's not actually the robber. He's the trouble maker. He's gonna interact with Caitlin. Paul's the robber because he's a little sneaky guy. He's still a good match. Which is really cool. So now he's a werewolf so he's being quiet. Which is really... You switched us and I grabbed a Tanner for myself, which was a bad choice. [SPEAKER_01] Can we get 15 guns? [SPEAKER_03] And that's what we're left with. I'm gonna blow for Paul. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah [SPEAKER_00] I'm almost willing to allow it. I mean, it's okay. I have no info on them. [SPEAKER_02] Okay [SPEAKER_02] No, no, because I was the wrong way.

So that, I think, I think this is... No, I think this is. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_03] I think princess [SPEAKER_03] No, no, no, no, I did grab myself the Tanner. Mm-hmm. I was actually the trouble. [SPEAKER_02] You were not filming. [SPEAKER_01] What are you saying you were the witch? You said you were the witch and you grabbed the tenor. [SPEAKER_03] with... when? Katah? [SPEAKER_03] and then told everybody not necessarily from this one I'm not giving that information I just put it in the center to show okay [SPEAKER_01] Not necessarily. [SPEAKER_00] over here. [SPEAKER_01] ? ? [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_01] It comes the other one that I saw was the witch. I don't believe you. Thank you. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_03] That's a fair point. Right, I will plead the fifth. [SPEAKER_02] What are you? What? Sorry. [SPEAKER_01] I said the two that I saw in the middle, one was the minion, I didn't reveal the other one.

Come on. [SPEAKER_00] No. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] I don't want it. I don't want it. I don't want it. More I just haven't given it enough to have it. But if you work, I actually didn't do it.

Okay, I don't know where we're at at all [SPEAKER_01] Obviously I could get a white okay [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, and what if you claim to be something? Uh, wait, well, you're just claiming to be able to confirm. You said you were the seer. I've looked at my car. Yeah, so I know what he is. Okay. And they both said they were on camera. Okay, right, right, right, right, right. All right, so on, on three, both of you say what Mike is. Okay, I have a doubt about that. On three. He did say it was good. Okay, ready? Oh, wait, I've got a better way to do this. Can we secretly hand you one of these instead of? No, no, no. No, no, no, no, I'm supposed to be one of them. Okay. [SPEAKER_02] You hurt, you... [SPEAKER_02] See you in my car. I know what he is. [SPEAKER_02] Okay, right. [SPEAKER_02] If you say what Mike is, okay? I have a vote on three. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] No, no, no, no, they're not supposed to be. They're only one, because I'm afraid to say that loud, because I'm not scared. [SPEAKER_01] No, I just don't want... Oh, info has to be open, yeah. I mean, I just see really nice. I just get the idea that one of you chooses that you're one and then another person can't choose. Yeah, if one of you has... [SPEAKER_00] This is gonna get the- [SPEAKER_02] one of you chooses that you're one of them other person can't. Yeah, if one of you hesitates, it's over. No, yeah, 100%. [SPEAKER_01] You have to say it. Yeah! On three. One, two, three. Joe Nigger. [SPEAKER_01] You said which? [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] So you and I know who's lying. Perfect. So, what are you guys? You're gonna share that with them. No, because they know who's lying too. We know which one of them is lying. So, why don't we watch this work the way we're all? There's three people who are good, which is really powerful and helpful. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] We know who's like [SPEAKER_02] So what do you guys? [SPEAKER_02] So why don't we like this work? There's three people here. [SPEAKER_02] So you're saying you were the seer then? Correct. And then you saw it. Yeah, and you saw my card, which was a good one. Which one of them said the... One of them said the... [SPEAKER_01] So, we can start devising the hij\u60df, like so. Now we combine our fear and the mind for some pages. [SPEAKER_01] One of them said the correct answer and one of them said the wrong answer. I mean, the only thing to offer. [SPEAKER_02] I mean, there's only two options. I have nothing to offer. I was in trouble. [SPEAKER_01] interesting. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, in interesting. Uh-huh. Okay, okay, okay. And then Paul. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] Did you wait guys the inside now? You need to guide this, this, this tea. Okay, so I'm like with the trouble maker and I believe you too. Yeah, I was the trouble maker. So these two are werewolves or one of them is a Tanner. Who'd you switch though? Please tell me it wasn't me. He just said these two. I don't know. We know those two are the werewolves because Justin said the witch and she's the right. So this is the interrogation. [SPEAKER_02] I knew you guys staying right here [SPEAKER_02] Okay, so I'm like, what's the Trump? [SPEAKER_02] She took this implication then, using switch camera. [SPEAKER_02] What do you mean? Who did you switch? Put it into it right now. Actually, who I switch doesn't matter in this situation. It is the two. [SPEAKER_01] It is the film one of them is The Minion. [SPEAKER_01] No, I'm gonna say who I switch does not matter right now. [SPEAKER_01] I trust them to the ends. I'm confused, I'm just interested in- Did you stop Mitchell then? I swapped Caitlin and Mitchell. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] I'm confused, I'm so stupid. [SPEAKER_01] So we vote. But one of them is a terrible... Oh, understand. [SPEAKER_02] One of them is a channel. Oh, understand because they were both good guys [SPEAKER_01] It kind of seems like Justin would be a Tanner being kind of brave about it and going into that kind of a situation. [SPEAKER_01] Takes guts. Takes Tanner guts. That makes sense. [SPEAKER_02] But at the same time would I be aggressive? Because you guys never vote for the person who's aggressive, right? That's true, also. [SPEAKER_02] So they don't want you to kill me. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, so then we kill Alicia. [SPEAKER_02] Oh, it's the hearted station. That's so tough. I think we just go for it. [SPEAKER_01] Oh, it's the hearted station. That's so tough. I think we just go for a lisha. [SPEAKER_02] Who did you rock from? I mean, also one of them could be the minute. It might not be, it might not be 10. That's why we had the job. It could be this or it could be. [SPEAKER_01] It might not be, it might not be Tanner. That's why we have the time. It could be this or it could be this. I don't think they're both really. I'm like relying entirely on this. I think his actions show Tanner the most. I'm kind of in all sorts of opinions. He could be pointing, trying to get it, I still think. [SPEAKER_02] This, I don't think they're both real. [SPEAKER_02] Bye. [SPEAKER_02] I'm kinda elsewhere that too. [SPEAKER_02] Either way we don't have over him though. Yeah, true. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, true. That's true. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, but she I mean it could be the other way as well. Yeah, but I Just be sitting in the just enjoying this a free Tanner [SPEAKER_01] Hold it like this. I'll show you how I freed myself. marble MBA? [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, that part, that's what makes me nervous is that Alicia doesn't say anything I said she was the ten, she took the ten, and she couldn't slip or the trollmaker. I'm voting Alicia. [SPEAKER_02] Because I said if she was the talent, you took the talent and slept. [SPEAKER_01] I think that less is the better choice. [SPEAKER_02] You think that's not different? Ever a Tanner kill. I think that's a Tanner. I think that's a sticker. [SPEAKER_01] I think she did grab the trouble maker makes me think she might [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, she grabbed the trollmaker the one I shut up sub talking with We're obviously on different teams her and I obviously [SPEAKER_01] Bye! [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, she I feel like she hesitated when she grabbed that like I think that was a werewolf move. I think delicious the best bet [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_00] Amen"}

[SPEAKER_01] the [SPEAKER_03] So who did you all make these two? Because I started out as a minion. You switch these two. I switched those two.

What is the channel? [SPEAKER_02] McDonald's at the turns. [SPEAKER_02] One of them is a fucking Tanner One of them is a werewolf [SPEAKER_03] One of the wearable bonus was a tenor. What are you claiming to be? One of the wearable ones. [SPEAKER_02] What do you claim in the- [SPEAKER_01] one of them is the ones of fucking I don't think we're on the same team but I think it's in both our benefit to just shut the fuck up [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_01] That means it's one of them's world-worms of Tanner, a hundred people. All right. You know what? Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah! [SPEAKER_01] Make your choice wisely, sons of bitches! [SPEAKER_02] I think it was just the world. Isn't that at least why wasn't anyone revealed? [SPEAKER_02] One is the [SPEAKER_03] The revealer would have been here then. [SPEAKER_02] Oh, okay, so so [SPEAKER_03] Okay, this is what I think happened. Yeah. I think it was this and then I was a troublemaker, so I switched these. But Paul still thought it was this. That's why he said he was the troublemaker. So make his Mitchell play and be the beginning of the game. What if we just kill him? And then he's lying. Yeah, I don't know why you're lying. No, we kill Mitch. Are you claiming to be the hunter? Yeah. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] I was a troublemaker so I switched these. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] So make a Mitchell play and be the beginning of the game. [SPEAKER_00] What if we just kill him? [SPEAKER_00] No one killed me at G. [SPEAKER_03] I was the hunter. I've been waiting for somebody to claim it. [SPEAKER_02] I'm gonna click move from the beginning, now you're just jumping in out, there's heat on it. Okay, so just did. There's no heat on it, man. No. There's something. Holla's. [SPEAKER_03] Okay, so just it's no heat on him. No, Paul is fucking with us. No, I promise I'm not okay, but you switched me [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_03] See you. [SPEAKER_00] Say you're winning the voting seconds left. [SPEAKER_01] 30 seconds left. I honestly call I'm telling you. But just that's what... [SPEAKER_02] That's why Mitch said saying nothing because now you're fucked [SPEAKER_01] I think we have to say. You and I? I guarantee I was one of these. Okay? Okay, so now I know which one I was, because I know which one you were. And now both of us, we actually want the same person to do it, do it, do it, do it, do it. [SPEAKER_02] We only have six seconds. No, because I get just fucking sh- Quick, someone do a break of sh- Shake off me! I'm gonna lock the ladder. Kill him.

[SPEAKER_02] I have 100% confidence that he's a little more so I'm not afraid [SPEAKER_01] Could I get understayed?

[SPEAKER_02] That's the question of what James wanted. Sorry, I can't... I think we just have to ignore him. Yeah. And like assume that he's like just the Tanner. Or like... One of the roles that maybe someone's lying about, yeah, I don't know. [SPEAKER_00] Bye! [SPEAKER_00] I did. [SPEAKER_00] What's the name about? Yeah, I don't know.

Specifically these two, Justin, it's fine. Because Mike looks me dead in the eyes and says, I am this one, I am that. And then Mitch laughs about it, like it's a fucking game to lie to your friends.

[SPEAKER_02] So, you're good. James, you know your vote? [SPEAKER_02] Do you want to spend the 14 seconds? Yes. [SPEAKER_01] Justin's voting me either way. Yes, because no matter what, if he's bad, because Mitch made it, I guess I switched them. If that one day... [SPEAKER_02] if you're bad I win. It's a win for him. Show us a win for you.

So I am not saying you as a wrong, just that I don't trust you, but I believe Mitchell's story. Okay. But you robbed him? No, that's how you do. Yes, yes. So he's saying he robbed him. So he's saying Mitch is the robber now and you're the seer. Yes. I mean, I robbed you and you were the revealer again.

[SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Okay, that's wrong. Why? Because I saw some cars in the middle and one of which you're calling out. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] Be so real. What do you do with me? [SPEAKER_01] Who did you make? [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] I said that. I am... Keep it up, Kayla. What are you doing, too? You... [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, both of you three robbers are not the only one in my opinion. So what have you guys? [SPEAKER_02] So one of you guys is a Tanner, I'm guessing, and one of you is a werewolf. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Or we have where will where will Minion? [SPEAKER_02] Who's the man here? [SPEAKER_01] No, there's not one of these... [SPEAKER_02] There's no one of these. Okay, what is your name? Name is one of the ones in the middle. So it's your name. So it's your name. [SPEAKER_01] Thank you. [SPEAKER_01] So, enjoy anything. [SPEAKER_01] So you saw in Ethereum, minion, and other dealer, that's what he's saying. [SPEAKER_02] What are you now? Still claiming wrong? [SPEAKER_01] So you're rockin' the rocker. And you're rocked from James. James and a song revealer. So he must have seen that. I believe Mitchell, even more now, and you're even more suspicious to me. [SPEAKER_02] So he must have... I believe Mitchell... [SPEAKER_01] James, what are you? Why? Just because James is a talking. I don't know why he's not talking. James, he obviously wasn't the revealer. He would have said it first and then got mad if someone took it. Shut up. Shut up. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] I'm real confused and don't know what to do. Remember people can lie. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, we didn't accidentally shuffle three robbers. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] I was like, is he a rocker face? I was like, that is. I was like, that is. [SPEAKER_01] Okay. You run? I'm running. Okay. I won't run that thing. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] Okay, James, are you good or bad? Just say that. [SPEAKER_01] I'm good! How? So, a troublemaker? Who'd you bex? Was it me? Sure. Fuck. James! [SPEAKER_01] I think it's the safest bet. Killing James. Don't kill me. I think the safest is Kaling. No, I don't trust either of you guys to the point that one of you... Yeah, but if we were both wearables, why would I be throwing under the bus? Because you're a Tanner. [SPEAKER_02] I think you are a dander. Yeah, I think you are. So then... [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I think you are so then both for Caitlin. I'm not going for Caitlin. I'm voting for James Don't fall for me. Yeah, it's what I think James.

I'm just saying something might have happened that made you bad overnight. Yeah, but I saw Trowel make it though. And it can't be because that's a rough joke. [SPEAKER_02] I saw Tronaker though. And it can't be because that's a robber. Robber. Robber can't. I'd be robber then. No, Mike's lying. Wait. No. So you should be a revealer now because you robbed. Correct. [SPEAKER_02] So what the fuck are you, Caitlin? You're not claiming anything. It's a good preparation for eight hours. It was taken from me. [SPEAKER_01] It's a good preparation. [SPEAKER_01] This is good preparation. What? Yeah, 100%. Heck yeah, this is the place to be for like more games. [SPEAKER_02] What? Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Okay, Mike, I'm trying not to get... Show me.

[SPEAKER_02] That's a no no no no check so because you two are on board with each other Kate one's at odds so she's a fucking tenor No, Kate one's like not really claiming anything so she came troublemaker so she's that well I don't think she's trouble maker. She's not because I saw it in the center. Okay. Why? [SPEAKER_01] Hey, Vander. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, why are you just taking Mike's butt as gloss hold on hold on hold on [SPEAKER_02] Okay. Because I think it's, his eyes got so big when you said that like what fuck you? Oh no, it's soft with the center, hey? No. No, that doesn't make sense then. Because that's what I saw. So you two...

I'm absolutely appealing to see them. You think the Justin's eyes get this large in his voice, gets that high pitch when he's lying. I mean, like, you guys... It's obvious for you guys to say that because you guys are the coin flip of Michina. Yeah. We killed Justin because Michina is clearly the Tanner. I think we killed Mike. No. And I think... I think we killed Mike because she's clearly the Tanner and wants to die. [SPEAKER_01] It must be why... [SPEAKER_01] These two are so suspicious. Yeah, I- [SPEAKER_01] I mean like you [SPEAKER_01] Yes. [SPEAKER_01] I think we kill Mike. No. And I think we kill Mike because she's clear of the dead.

[SPEAKER_00] I don't mean [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] We will always be friends. [SPEAKER_02] hm We are [SPEAKER_01] Simple right? [SPEAKER_01] Which we can't kill Mitch.

[SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_01] FASTER [SPEAKER_01] I am probably aware of all of this because I was the drunk. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] I don't know why you're arguing that you are the drug and someone else is taking it. Well no- [SPEAKER_01] I wouldn't know I want to be careful that we don't vote for Tanner and I'm praying I'm a troll winger or something I'm telling myself [SPEAKER_00] Time is up, everyone. Three.

I've done that before. Well he wrote two times. Yeah, that's a first person. It's true. It's true. Talk isn't always the truthiest. Well Justin was the first one. First thing did give a little bit of, like, I appreciate that what I said wasn't really that I confirmed anything, but I did give. No, it wasn't Shakespeare. [SPEAKER_01] Because I do trust you but what he has here [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Did you? Did you? I've done that before. We came up to times. Yeah, that's a first, first time. [SPEAKER_01] Well, Justin was the first one. [SPEAKER_02] But I did say I know there's a syrup there. And I really wanted to tell you guys who was before. They come to it so I could build that trust.

[SPEAKER_00] That is so awesome. What percent? [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] What percentage? [SPEAKER_02] 100? Well, if he's not telling the truth, then you were the robber. Or he was the robber.

I don't really think he was actually a robber to begin with. Why are you trying to be here on me? Shit. What if they're both real? That could be a thing. [SPEAKER_02] I don't really make mistakes. [SPEAKER_02] What if they're both well that could be a thing I wouldn't I wouldn't want to put you know, okay Mike You need to stop at your attention to Mitchell cuz you know clearly no poisoning your mind.

That's what he's doing. That's what he was doing. Kill me. [SPEAKER_00] only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_02] but just think of literally trying to be like, I'm making a vote for Mitch so that we don't overman. [SPEAKER_02] They don't really seem to be working together.

[SPEAKER_00] You're the last person to go, your information's safe. After I got the wearable, I switched it with somebody. That's the trouble maker.

[SPEAKER_01] I know you can turn it off. No, wait, I'm just going to swing it. [SPEAKER_00] You can turn it off. Wait, just wing it. Just wing it, just wing it, man. We'll go at seven minutes.

[SPEAKER_01] Is she gonna tell us when there's one minute remaining? No. [SPEAKER_01] Come on. [SPEAKER_01] **song plays** [SPEAKER_00] So we have a wizard. [SPEAKER_00] I-I-I-maybe I'm on his team. There's two werewolves out there. [SPEAKER_01] Nah, you want to claim a re-vealer? [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] inches. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] It was the heart of his image. [SPEAKER_01] It was the hudder as I met. So no one switched to here. [SPEAKER_01] Paul, over here. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. What's such a myth? Not match with Mike. [SPEAKER_00] Well, I look after so, I mean, and as you're aware, Wolf. [SPEAKER_00] Mover you, Jessin. [SPEAKER_01] I don't want to say that. [SPEAKER_01] and he was the Tanner. [SPEAKER_01] I worked in the middle. [SPEAKER_00] What do you see? [SPEAKER_01] What did you see? I saw a Tanner. [SPEAKER_01] and another werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] Mitch was by himself, he woke up. These are the ones that I saw, where. Would you see them? [SPEAKER_02] resurpreter so that you are admitted to the Christ in New Jersey. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] You've seen the mill. Probably another world. I didn't look at the mills, be honest. [SPEAKER_00] \ud300 \uc911.. [SPEAKER_01] So you gotta get awhile. [SPEAKER_02] That's not true. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] Where did you do that? [SPEAKER_02] I'm just gonna leave it at that. Sure, it's spicy. [SPEAKER_00] so just gonna \u0441\u043cench [SPEAKER_00] I mean, he's a guaranteed bet. And this is the second world. I think there's a second world we've felt there. But I don't know what there is. What a thing it would have been. [SPEAKER_02] And then [SPEAKER_01] yes there's a [SPEAKER_01] Who would have been pool? [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] It might be. [SPEAKER_00] It would be literally any of the three of us because nothing can be confirmed. [SPEAKER_00] I mean, Mitch got a convert mic. Yeah, I mean, I believe mine. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I mean, I believe Mike. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, that's kind of fair. Mmm. Because even if we were wearables together, I wouldn't be throwing them under the bus this hard. [SPEAKER_01] Unless they're doing like this weird note because then their werewolves they couldn't be working together on this. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] And if you switched us, Mike would be saying something. Right, so did you truly switch us? Yeah. Yeah, well then yeah. Yeah, I was the revealer. Yeah, I was the seer. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Now I've just the revealer. [SPEAKER_00] So, let's hear also bad, what if one of you is a tenor? [SPEAKER_01] Well, so for example, if I was the Tanner, I don't care anymore on the villagers team, because Mike's now Tanner, but I wasn't, I was a seer. [SPEAKER_00] And I was a revealer and I looked at Mitch's card. And it was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] So I mean, I'm good to move from mentioned. [SPEAKER_00] I mean I'm good to go for mention this is falling to [SPEAKER_01] I don't know what he was saying. What is there to modify? Like you're the only one who modifies my kingdom. I think what I'm saying. I think, I think. [SPEAKER_00] I think when I said that I looked at somebody who was a werewolf, Mitch was just like, well, I'm the only werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] And he took a limb hoping that he got trouble made, but he didn't. So now he's just himself. [SPEAKER_01] This should be a bit of a bummer. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] It's a camera light. [SPEAKER_01] I think you were the most beautiful. What do you think you think I stole from you? [SPEAKER_02] You are the main footer. [SPEAKER_02] No, I looked last. I don't, I don't like you so much. [SPEAKER_00] too you listen listen listen listen listen listen [SPEAKER_00] That's, yeah, that's what I'm concerned that. One of you might have robbed from Mitchell. No, but I look last. [SPEAKER_01] So then, if anything, it's Mike. [SPEAKER_00] nobody would have been if i could have been that you know he's right that narrow could be that i was the robber i picked his card up and was like all i'm aware of the same that's a that's a possibility that's too big of a place [SPEAKER_01] Thank you so much. Have a great day. [SPEAKER_02] I could have lied. [SPEAKER_01] Thanks for joining us! [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] I'm aware of this now. That's a possibility. I think that's too big of a play for us to do on our first game of Wearwall. That's for the night. We have to work into that. No, I'm not trying to say like that's what happened. No, no, no. It's a very interesting scenario. I don't think it happened to. I was... [SPEAKER_00] realistically soon, [SPEAKER_00] No, I'm not trying to say like that's what happened. Yeah, it's a very interesting area. I don't think it happened. I was definitely a word either. That's a good strategy though. I think I would use that. If you're sweet. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] That's a good strategy though. I think that's just that. If you switch Mitchell with some phone and have more of a game but because you switched off, then us, nothing has happened. [SPEAKER_00] I think you might be the towner. [SPEAKER_01] But if it was a Tanner, like I said, I don't care. [SPEAKER_00] Because you switch them. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, then I'm now a villager. [SPEAKER_00] But then why? But he's not throwing himself, he's not even, well. Because yeah, like, he would have come out and said, I'm the tenor then, because if you did the switch, right? [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_02] And as the part of your troublemaker role, will you tell us who you actually, so? No, stop it, that's me. [SPEAKER_00] No, stop it that's the way I can swish that's why I'm like shit [SPEAKER_01] What's wrong with it? So if I was a Tanner, I don't care anymore, right? Because you switched me But I were you though. No, I was a seer [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_04] Are you where you though? [SPEAKER_00] but we hope you all enjoy your\u9b5a Institute of Medicine and Chemistry www.ken devata.co.uk [SPEAKER_01] Like, why does it matter if I'm no longer what I was? I think we are at 20 seconds. 20 seconds. What's going on? Atum Krasvig. Good morning. [SPEAKER_00] I think we are at 20. [SPEAKER_04] I think we just killed Mitchell. [SPEAKER_01] I think we just killed Mitchell. You think we'll kill him? Well, everything points to the move. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] man. That I don't know when I make personal mistakes is [SPEAKER_02] I have no last words. [SPEAKER_01] And you were the revealer and you saw him? That's all, yeah, 100%.

I troubled made you both back. Nice. Should we go to a vote? So, sure, can you confirm any of it? [SPEAKER_01] Can you confirm any of it? I was at where we got cold feet for like a sec. [SPEAKER_01] And it was like, not in words. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_03] Mike, any contribution, Tanner. Okay, I called it all. Calling it now, we can go to the vote. [SPEAKER_03] So, who would kill?

[SPEAKER_01] the trouble maker. Yeah. And you switch them to. Yeah. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Okay. Six, six, six. [SPEAKER_02] Alright, that was the sear. That was not the robber. [SPEAKER_03] That's what I think that's an ice-up. [SPEAKER_01] I saw that it was not the wrong way. I looked at myself. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Michaelviews [SPEAKER_02] Besides the Tanner, because we know that's what you were. I think so. [SPEAKER_02] Spicy or euro [SPEAKER_03] Oh you're Rob? I had a background, sorry, yeah you're Rob from Dustin. I've never heard of that. But he was this year. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I'm probably well I saw because I might be the oh [SPEAKER_03] built provided [SPEAKER_03] I might be the teacher. Oh yeah. A lot happened. I probably were. [SPEAKER_01] A lot happened. I think I might be the tenor. I think you are. [SPEAKER_03] I think you are too. I think I just, I had a lot of playlists. I don't know how to play. I was so close, it was just backwards. And then you saw the sear in the middle. [SPEAKER_01] I don't know how I was so close. [SPEAKER_03] Okay. [SPEAKER_02] And they're looking in the middle. There was another werewolf. Oh, both of you. No, Mike and I. Yeah, we said hi to each other. [SPEAKER_03] Oh, both of you. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, we said hi to each other. We didn't hear us. True. So there's any other villages out there, any info? It's so mental. It seems like it's a like a religious village. I think we can make just a me kind of night. [SPEAKER_01] Did it hear? [SPEAKER_02] It seems like it's like a miniature. I think it's just a me kind of night. [SPEAKER_01] I robbed from you. I think we killed Mitchell. [SPEAKER_03] So you know what I'm like enough? [SPEAKER_03] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Yummy Match. [SPEAKER_01] I don't know if he's like lying where he switched very normally, she's a drum maker. He's not a drum maker. He's just switched. [SPEAKER_02] \u041e\u043dudge \u0414\u0430\u0432\u0430\u0439\u0442\u0435 Switch [SPEAKER_02] I didn't see the 12-meg in the center. Well, I feel very alone now. I saw the drunk here. And I saw a whir-woof right there. So it was lying earlier. When I said there was two. There's only one. [SPEAKER_03] I feel very alone. I saw the drunk here. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, there's a lot of info going on in chat. There's some of my guesses that are coming from, unfortunately. [SPEAKER_01] I think we've all met. [SPEAKER_02] with all my [SPEAKER_02] So, how do you switch? [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_03] So what did you say? It was something. It was something. It was something. [SPEAKER_02] I need some sleep. [SPEAKER_00] Communications [SPEAKER_01] What if it matches the town? [SPEAKER_01] What if there's just an additional maker? I mean a tenor. Or there might not be a tenor. There might be not be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_02] there might not be a Tanner. There might be not be a werewolf. Well there's at least one werewolf or Tanner. [SPEAKER_02] I mean, there could be wear-off or off-canter. No, because this is a truck. [SPEAKER_01] I mean, there could be... [SPEAKER_02] I saw it in the middle. [SPEAKER_01] \u03c4\u03acorden [SPEAKER_01] Mike's a Tanner. Oh, but then Drunk would be out and then we'd switch. [SPEAKER_02] My best. [SPEAKER_02] Now this [SPEAKER_01] If you were lying though and it was wear welfare of tenor, the drunk would be out at 100% Yes, but the editor would have been saying as I had not lying [SPEAKER_02] 100% [SPEAKER_03] I don't like bitches, dude. Dang! [SPEAKER_02] I mean, he's never confirmed again when we've asked him who he's switched. [SPEAKER_03] I've said like 10 times to a switch but I asked you and you give me this because I don't fucking this is garbage I'm by myself. I can tell who do you think the two people I said I switched. I want the people that I said I switched [SPEAKER_02] summaroy [SPEAKER_01] sounds true. [SPEAKER_01] God! [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_01] Acheen Down Native University [SPEAKER_02] It switched you, it switched you. Wait, not going to pulp. [SPEAKER_02] Maybe I'm pulling a ball. That's the thing, right? Like we don't know. And like this fucking ball man that's shown over the troublemaker makes it so that we can't actually start talking about 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_03] 30 seconds left. Nope. [SPEAKER_02] Oh, see? I'm gonna just sit here for 30 seconds. So we're killing Mitch? Can't. I just go to a default. [SPEAKER_01] So we're killing Mitch. Okay, I'm just going to vote. I was the Tanner. I'm going to believe Mitchell, because I'm probably not going to win if I'm still the Tanner, so whatever. So that would mean that Justin's the Tanner, which I mean, I'm probably this year. So we should go together and we should produce a little for Mike. Or what did you claim to be? You didn't claim to be any guys? [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] I think we'll top off this part. [SPEAKER_01] I was actually the robber. [SPEAKER_02] Okay, that heard you're up from. [SPEAKER_01] I don't want to say that. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, there we go, Mike. [SPEAKER_01] Now we go to the left. [SPEAKER_02] No. [SPEAKER_01] Maybe I robbed from... Paul? I think I'm... No, I think Mike had left. I think Mike probably robbed from you. Did that happen in that order? No. [SPEAKER_02] I think I know I think I think Mike is that [SPEAKER_01] No, you would still be the terror. [SPEAKER_01] So you probably, oh fuck. Did you rob from somebody who is actually bad? Is there actually okay? I probably, I'm gonna tell you that you were like the only person that... I was a weirdo. [SPEAKER_02] I put it. I'm gonna tell you the only person that I was aware of. So there's a werewolf in here. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, there's there's this is so effed There's two bad guys Tanner and a robber and then a fucking if I'm Where was it which I promised he started? [SPEAKER_01] where Tanner, which I promised he started. That's why there's no other info coming and playing as a villain. Three."}

[SPEAKER_05] You're the robber now. You robbed the insomnia? I'm not saying anything. I did not rob that. I was. I wasn't the robber. I was. [SPEAKER_03] I'm not saying anything. I did not. I wasn't the wrong man. I wasn't the wrong man. I woke up as the fuck in a zombie act. You're all right. I was saying they were a zombie act. Listen, I wasn't the robber, but I woke up as the robber as the zombie act. So somebody robbed me. Somebody act for me. And somebody act for me. And somebody act and woke up. What does that make sense when you saw me? [SPEAKER_01] I wasn't the wrong. I wasn't the wrong. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, you're all right. I'm gonna say they were some. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] then somebody rebuh [SPEAKER_00] Sorry. [SPEAKER_05]  [SPEAKER_01] How does that make sense if you saw Robert in the middle, buddy? Yeah, that... [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, that's fucking bullshit. I think this is what we have on our hands here. This is fucking eight. This is eight. I'm opening this up. [SPEAKER_01] I'm fucking eight. You say you woke up as a robber? Yeah. That's bull crap. [SPEAKER_04] Nice. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah. [SPEAKER_03] That's so why would why would you if that happened? No, they just make any sense. Why is that why is this something? [SPEAKER_05] But it doesn't make sense. [SPEAKER_03] Those are both villager roles. [SPEAKER_03] What do you mean? Those are both villagerals. Like it doesn't make sense for you to be lying about that. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_03] get access to building be!) gotta get car parking [SPEAKER_05] You guys were like both all up in the middle of the fucking night. Just didn't. [SPEAKER_01] You guys ain't got both lemon and salt on the neck. [SPEAKER_05] All right, we gotta figure out you both know whether this robber was or was not here. That's what's weird because I was the robber Yeah, we both know that [SPEAKER_03] He did not rob for me because I was the assembly guy. Do not believe you at all. Okay. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, I was pulling you to the kitchen. I was pulling a plus for you, no. I rock from Paul. [SPEAKER_04] Nothing makes sense. No. [SPEAKER_03] Oh, okay, yes, yes, no, that doesn't make sense. So they missed that [SPEAKER_01] Oh, okay, yes, yeah. [SPEAKER_01] So the Mitch that robber was in the middle, so we got a fucking kill in my head. [SPEAKER_05] You guys are in my head now I think I missed saw what's the price [SPEAKER_03] Which I believe you, we have to kill one of them too. [SPEAKER_05] Okay, one of them was a Tanner. What? Why? I know they're not both werewolves. I know that for 100% facts. I saw a werewolf in there. Like I also know there was a robber in the middle, but there was. I'm pretty sure there was not a robber out there. There was a fun, I'm pretty. You guys are lowering my confidence, but I started off at 100% confident. [SPEAKER_04] Why? I got another- [SPEAKER_03] Another name. [SPEAKER_01] with werewolves I know that for what [SPEAKER_01] I saw a werewolf. Like I also know there was a robber in the middle of the werewolf. [SPEAKER_03] So you're saying you're sear and this is Robert Wurl? Yeah. [SPEAKER_03] No, I was. You heard that. I think the only reason that Mike would be lying about that is if he's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] So that's why Mitch is the safe kill. [SPEAKER_03] No, no, no, no. Mitch is not the same kind of... Yeah. I think Justin's the same kind of kill. [SPEAKER_05] No, because I think I know Justin's a safe kill. But Paul also sent me the robber. [SPEAKER_03] But Paul also sent me the robber. Then I'll be on your team Mitch of open. And I'm confirmed. [SPEAKER_01] hoping i'm [SPEAKER_05] Oh, we thought all three of you were lying and that doesn't even make sense because I saw where we're all [SPEAKER_05] Why do you think I- [SPEAKER_04] Oh, who is it so? [SPEAKER_03] So I am 100% on your side. I believe you. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] He's gonna vote for you. I'm not gonna vote for you. I'm gonna vote for Jeff. [SPEAKER_03] I'm not gonna force you. I'm gonna vote for Jessica. It's just no way you can see the water throwing the end of the bus to the mobs. Yeah. One minute remaining. [SPEAKER_00] Oh, god, I'm soooooyoung [SPEAKER_03] But what was Paul? I don't know, man. Paul was probably the trouble. Probably no. Paul was a Tanner. [SPEAKER_03] You're the wherewith. No, I'm sure Mike is the 10. I don't know how many. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I'll come mic. I'll come mic her, Mitch. [SPEAKER_01] Both of them are lying. How long do I know what this is right here? Mike did you... [SPEAKER_03] Did you start as a Tanner? No, I started the insomnia. No, Mike, I need to know if you started as a... I did not start as a Tanner. I started with its app. [SPEAKER_00] It's all me, I think. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_04] I did. [SPEAKER_00] Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_05] I'm gonna be voting, Justin.

You can always count on the fact that I'm gonna say I did one thing first to get information and then right near the end I'm gonna say what I actually did. And you know that the last thing I say is true because I always do that. That's how it always goes. This time I'm gonna say what I did truthfully the first time. Whoa. That's good. The biggest even chat is sick of my unobulls shit. [SPEAKER_04] We believe you. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_01] Which you should be able to confirm because you're not the inside the acting mark, right? Yeah, so where are you? [SPEAKER_02] Mm-hmm, great. Yeah, so where are you? Correct. Tell me what you were. [SPEAKER_04] Sir [SPEAKER_02] Hell fucking yes! Yep. Hell fucking yes! See where this is here. So what about, I'm thinking something about it. Great! Yep. Cool. [SPEAKER_04] I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. [SPEAKER_02] I didn't see any bells in the middle. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_03] No! No! That's so funny. How funny is the rubber? We fucking all of us, this... Oh, okay. We're just enjoying our most building. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_04] That was so fun. I was the robber. [SPEAKER_02] It's just showing our most buildings. There's only one where we'll walk. What else did you see? What else did I see? [SPEAKER_04] a [SPEAKER_01] This is only one where... [SPEAKER_02] Son, it's over here. [SPEAKER_04] Classic, classic, classic Justin's a world of things, trying to put me down. [SPEAKER_02] Okay. [SPEAKER_01] 3An [SPEAKER_01] So there still could be two wearings kind of been here. [SPEAKER_01] It could be just a tenor out, but it could also be a tenor with here. So you switched us. Who'd you rock from, Mike? [SPEAKER_04] We know he didn't swap us. [SPEAKER_04] We'll find out in a bit. [SPEAKER_03] \u6211\u5011\u6703\u7d50\u675f [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_03] either either rob the tenor were will mhm i either rob the tenor or were will [SPEAKER_01] either Rob Bapick and [SPEAKER_04] Mmm, I believe you were you this year for real? I believe it. I was a Tanner. And I totally guessed this year that was lucky. I think he's robbed it from me. [SPEAKER_02] I think he's robbed it from. [SPEAKER_02] Don't check out. [SPEAKER_01] So yeah, that checks out. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_03] so that the dog will make... [SPEAKER_02] So we don't kill Mike. [SPEAKER_01] We just wrote we would go to the left apparently. Now we're saying that there's no where we're at. [SPEAKER_02] No we're [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Here's the thing. Mike actually stole from me. [SPEAKER_01] I guess that's easier right? Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] because I was a rebel. [SPEAKER_02] That's why he's happy that we're not killing him. He'd be fighting if he was, so he's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_02] But I'm a Tanner so I'll still kill me. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, because that means you're the tender if the switch happened. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, because I saw it as a wear-wolf and then saw me. Are you? [SPEAKER_04] You have some big decisions to make. [SPEAKER_02] So this is what we're currently looking at. I know I'm voting. [SPEAKER_04] I know I'm voting. I absolutely know who's still on my team. [SPEAKER_01] Why are you absolutely... [SPEAKER_03] I mean, I know that I'm myself and I'm a world. Which one am I? Oh, I'm missing. [SPEAKER_01] Oh Mich thanks to you Clara. [SPEAKER_02] through the transmitter. [SPEAKER_02] He's a robber. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, can we really quickly go over the sequence of events? Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Where will Saun Sound the Ac? Okay, Robert, still for me. Switched us. [SPEAKER_02] That's my working theory. The fact is, my voice is okay with getting killed. Okay, we... [SPEAKER_01] This mic was okay with getting killed. Okay, we killed Mitch cause I accidentally switched micimitch. Duh. [SPEAKER_01] and you can count on that because I guarantee it, I always do that. [SPEAKER_01] No, I didn't, a little bit early but still. No, then we don't kill him, because I actually rubbed from him, so he's back at the Tanner again. One minute, I'll remind you. [SPEAKER_00] One minute, really on it. [SPEAKER_02] So what did you say a row from? Mitch. [SPEAKER_02] How come that she deserves a tanter with? [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I'll kill Mitch to either kill Werrwolf or kill his hammer. I don't care. [SPEAKER_04] Thank you. [SPEAKER_04] As long as the world's not- NO! OOP! [SPEAKER_01] No! Oop! [SPEAKER_02] Here we go. I don't know what's happening. Let's go back in time. [SPEAKER_02] We're saying you're up for me. Sure. Because you were okay with us not killing you. [SPEAKER_01] I mean, yeah. [SPEAKER_02] And you put these two. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_00] let [SPEAKER_01] Now now [SPEAKER_01] So we're saying that? So what did you offer him? I did rub this way and the maze were switched. No! [SPEAKER_03] Yeah! [SPEAKER_04] I'm not being so much. No, no, no. Oh, we still have a tanner. [SPEAKER_01] That's so weak. No, no, no, you say you switch us. Yeah, Mitch is back in the tent. Are we killed? [SPEAKER_03] That's so weird. [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_02] So you say you switch to us? Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Just now we're going to get on the middle. No way. [SPEAKER_01] No, we vote Justin. No, he's back at the Tanner. We gotta vote Justin. He's back at the Tanner. [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_02] Let's go. [SPEAKER_03] Nobody tries to start his every walk."}

[SPEAKER_01] It's trying to make her good. It's on the arc. Close your eyes. Everyone. [SPEAKER_00] I want to wake up. So I need to get something out that's very important and very clear before Justin says that. [SPEAKER_01] important. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Can anyone confirm this? [SPEAKER_00] No. Sorry. There's like a lot in the gear that you're the only one who can see that. Yeah, no, but like the only. So he could, this could have been the case. And he saw it. This is 100% the truth. We need to figure out who is trying to so dissent because they are the Tanner. That's all we got to do. I agree with them. [SPEAKER_01] So here's the thing, see ya! [SPEAKER_01] The only, the only. [SPEAKER_01] Und das aber ... [SPEAKER_00] Not someone to say. Was anyone on the song, Jack? What? It's someone had to be. I was. Like, you switched me to Justin, right? [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] I think he's the teacher just like... I just want to do with somebody I know. [SPEAKER_00] I just want to do with somebody, I know I can say who yet. [SPEAKER_00] Should we wake up as the tanner or the sear? [SPEAKER_00] bitches the danner. Well did you switch these two? I did. Yeah. Okay, we vote for Mitchell. No, we don't vote for Mitchell. Yes we do. Cause I rubbed from Justin. Who was the where? No, no. No. I 100% was the sear I tossed sautie werewolves in the middle. 100% vote for me. Don't let Paul so dissent. As I said, there is someone who would do it. He thinks he's the tanner now, that's why. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Now we don't vote for this. [SPEAKER_01] No... [SPEAKER_01] I 100% was the... [SPEAKER_01] don't be [SPEAKER_00] I'm just going left, I'm going left. [SPEAKER_00] Mitch is not saying anything because he knows he's the werewolf because he woke up as the werewolf. There's no werewolves. That's literally impossible. [SPEAKER_01] She's fishing. [SPEAKER_01] There's nowhere. [SPEAKER_00] And I think... [SPEAKER_00] It was this and then... [SPEAKER_00] I rostle or did you rob from him and then I just wish you guys back [SPEAKER_01] Russell. Who did you rob from? [SPEAKER_01] him. [SPEAKER_00] No, I wrote from Justin, it was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_00] And then if you switch me and Mitchell, Mitchell's not the werewolf. There's no werewolves. They're a truth in the center. [SPEAKER_00] I think if there is a werewolf, it would be Justin but I don't think he is a werewolf. I think Justin thinks he's the Tanner now. No, I'm just falling left. No, that's all I'm doing. I'm saying I didn't switch them. I 100% I switched you two. Ow, ow. Oh, hi. And he's not changing his story, so I'm inclined to believe Justin. [SPEAKER_01] I'm just voting left. No, that's all I'm saying. I didn't switch them. I underbreast. [SPEAKER_00] I mean, I think we have the vote left. Can we at least vote right so that I can vote for Mitchell? Nope. [SPEAKER_00] Tap papers. This is very cool, do you? This is said to have been the best. And so when we were listening like this She believed that the company that agreed to [SPEAKER_00] Can we go over Mitchell? We can do it with- We can go over. You can lose the game. That's fine. That's fine. We're a lot of road center, right? No. [SPEAKER_01] We can do it with- So we've done it, right? Oh, but yeah, you can lose the game. That's fine. That's fine. That's what we'll lose. We're a lot of votes in our right? No. [SPEAKER_00] I thought if we all agree, I think it's the rules you put left. Is it? Oh. I thought it was just... [SPEAKER_01] I guess if [SPEAKER_01] reassuring [SPEAKER_01] \uc9c4\uc9dc\ub85c [SPEAKER_00] It's isn't the book we're left. [SPEAKER_00] I'm ready to go to vote. I guess that kinda makes sense. [SPEAKER_01] I made a big mistake. [SPEAKER_00] So your hands won't lift? Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_00] Tannerite fuck it up, but we'll see. Well, the Tanner will lose if they fuck it up. That's true. Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Wait! [SPEAKER_00] Oh no the villagers wouldn't no matter what now. As long as we don't kill the Tanner. As long as we don't kill the Tanner. Because no where will exist. As long as we don't kill the Tanner we win. We don't kill the Tanner we win. God. [SPEAKER_01] As long as you don't kill the Tanner. As long as you don't kill the Tanner. Because you don't know where we'll fix it. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I got a little cut up in my own life Who did you say? [SPEAKER_00] You wouldn't make it. Okay, Mitchell's the 10.

I thought that was fascinating. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I thought that was fascinating, didn't I? [SPEAKER_01] How do we proceed past this conflict? [SPEAKER_02] But one of you guys is the werewolf. What is the Tanner? No, Tanner's in the middle. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_03] Oh, what are the tanner? [SPEAKER_03] Oh, yep, nailed it.

I'm fine with you guys like voting for both of us. And then I vote for you, we both die. [SPEAKER_02] That doesn't happen. Yeah, that actually does sound... Kill both of us? Pretty tight. If you know there's your Tanner, you know what it is, you know what it is. [SPEAKER_01] If you know there's your Tanner, you know what it is, you know what it is. You know what it is, you know what it is. So you guys are one of us. [SPEAKER_03] So you guys are one of us. And you guys will for each other. But if one of us is the Red Wolf, we would vote for one of you two. Yeah, so we call Paul. [SPEAKER_02] and then you guys will for each other. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, so we come. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] cause I'm fine with that plan here, so... [SPEAKER_03] Like we could do that but Mischwitch is glow for one of you and then the where wolf would win.

[SPEAKER_02] model [SPEAKER_01] If we get's wrong, yeah, you have to guess right. [SPEAKER_02] Yes, wrong. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] So we vote for Mitch.

[SPEAKER_03] I was boring. I was one of these two. [SPEAKER_04] I was one of these two. Drunks not boring. And spree excited. It was boring for me. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah. [SPEAKER_03] Who you? How is the seer? [SPEAKER_04] Oh, oh, no, I don't think you were. We got too serious [SPEAKER_03] We got two Sears and a troublemaker. Okay, so obviously one of them were a werewolf. [SPEAKER_04] Yi Fluei [SPEAKER_04] Who'd you switch? I'd switch Chris. [SPEAKER_03] Was I involved in the switch? No, so it's these two. [SPEAKER_03] What? A little bit. Interesting. So obviously one of these are werewolf and now the other one's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_03] So, cancels. [SPEAKER_04] You switch us to... [SPEAKER_02] Do you switch us too? I switch Chris. [SPEAKER_03] I know, man. I know, man. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_04] control people. [SPEAKER_02] I'm confirmed that you switched I could have I could have switched Mitch because he's not saying what he is and you guys are fighting over it So [SPEAKER_03] But didn't you already say not mention? [SPEAKER_01] N [SPEAKER_03] Okay. [SPEAKER_03] Alright Mike, you started as a werewolf. So no, I was a seer. If you were a seer, then why did you see? Yep, move. [SPEAKER_04] So I was a steer. [SPEAKER_04] I looked at two in the center. What were they? I saw a werewolf and a good card, and I'm not going to reveal which one it is. [SPEAKER_03] What were they? [SPEAKER_03] Would you see? I saw a werewolf and the drunken in the middle. [SPEAKER_03] So, which two did you guys look at? [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_04] I didn't point out which ones are which to do I'm not gonna reveal it cuz I don't I don't I don't I'm I'm a seer so I don't think he's about to drink in the center so I believe you're still the drunk So I don't want to tell you which the werewolf was [SPEAKER_03] I didn't point out- [SPEAKER_03] yet. I have a very strong opinion of which ones are the werewolf but I don't want to say anything until I know who got switched. [SPEAKER_01] If Rachel thought he was the one who wouldn't have mattered if I switched him, he would, uh, thought he was the drunk. Wouldn't have mattered. Cause he would switch. [SPEAKER_01] after I switched it. [SPEAKER_03] I don't think that. [SPEAKER_03] It's true. I'm an idiot. So even if I if he's made me the werewolf then I would I would wear a Who would my switch whip possibly? [SPEAKER_01] I would. [SPEAKER_04] So who'd my switch went possibly? So it was me and Chris. Okay, so I was the werewolf [SPEAKER_03] Okay. [SPEAKER_03] wait what? [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_03] So now he's the one that's wrong with you. [SPEAKER_03] Because I 100% was the one who will be the lone winner. Oh, I see what you did. You, you, you, you got one step ahead of it. Because he was the world winner. Yeah, and now you're the world's best. But you do have to have it. If you found out, you can't do it. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Oh I see what- [SPEAKER_00] And now you're the one who checks it. But you're the one who checks it. [SPEAKER_04] Now no he's now freaking out because he thinks he's the were all because they go to it. Okay, so they're good you are the world [SPEAKER_03] Okay, so then if you were the werewolf off the start, which card did you look at in the middle? Because there's only one werewolf. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, which card? [SPEAKER_04] I saw you. [SPEAKER_04] Haha [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_04] He's so dirty. [SPEAKER_03] I saw one where we'll finish. That's my lifelong friend and I don't recognize him. [SPEAKER_04] I saw Whirl from the center. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, I still saw where I was. [SPEAKER_03] I still saw the- So I was the werewolf and I saw a seer in the center. I believe he was the werewolf. Which is why I wanted to call the seer up this dark. This card was the seer. [SPEAKER_04] Yes, here. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] I believe he was the world. [SPEAKER_03] I believe he was the werewolf because he said he saw a drunk and I was the drunk. And then so now you're the werewolf. Alright. [SPEAKER_03] Holy food. I'll come back. Yeah, I'll come back. That's a spirit. All right. [SPEAKER_00] How do I make this one? Yeah, how do you make it? [SPEAKER_02] Alright. And if it's not my style of wild dog, Chris! Ha ha ha! [SPEAKER_03] "}

[SPEAKER_01] And one of them was the witch, so there's no other messing with the center. [SPEAKER_01] Was he with the one the trouble maker? The other one was the trouble maker. Well, it seems Brad and I are in a bit of a pickle role. This is not good. I believe that because I didn't get swaff once. Yeah, Mike. So I think Mike's good.

You guys were adamant about the last game too. I was the drunk. [SPEAKER_01] I was a drug. You know. The ladies got a stick together. But it's information. It's the most ridiculous. They could vote for you. They're not going to vote for you. She's either wrong or she's lying. And I don't get why she would lie in a situation. Unless she's a werewolf. Well, she's trying to throw me out of the box. Does this change anything? I did switch you with somebody. [SPEAKER_00] I don't know why she... [SPEAKER_00] trying to throw me out of the pot. [SPEAKER_00] switch me with somebody? That's really interesting. I can't confirm either of those. I can confirm that. What do you mean? That's what I saw. What's order here? I'm betting you switch last. [SPEAKER_01] I switched glass. That's what that was. But Drunko's after me. So if he was the drunk... [SPEAKER_00] Even if that's what that was, he's still the werewolf. Cause that's definitely what was there. [SPEAKER_01] She's throwing me out of a bus and I can't defend myself. Because I'm dead. [SPEAKER_00] I can't defend myself. [SPEAKER_00] because I'm getting that's what that was. [SPEAKER_01] Supply switched you to. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, so well [SPEAKER_01] Well then if I was a werewolf, you're a werewolf. Yeah, I have no idea what I was because I was a drunk. [SPEAKER_00] I have no idea what it was because I was a drunk. No, the way I was. Not the drunk. [SPEAKER_01] I have no idea what I ended up being. Okay, so if you just... Well, no, if I switch them, the drunko is after. So even if you weren't... If you were actually the drunk beforehand, you're still the guaranteed bet for being a werewolf. I'm still one? The guaranteed bet for werewolf. If you were actually the drunko. If I was drunk... Okay, but you switched us though, right? No, 100%. Yeah. Okay, then I actually was a werewolf to begin with. She called me out and she was the correct. This is exactly what happened to you and the werewolf. So I'm the werewolf. Fucking killed that. I got it. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, so... [SPEAKER_00] your team back. [SPEAKER_00] If. [SPEAKER_00] You're the wearable. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I think that's right. Yeah, she's right. I was aware of that. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, she's right. I was the right last time. I was not a drunk. I looked at this one. This one was a drunk though Which is why I took that role. So I don't know what you're doing. I think you did. I may have oh The line the story [SPEAKER_00] I don't know why you're going to make you do. I may have. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] I'm so uncomfortable right now. Tell you miss out. Every one. I don't know what's that got right on. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] But it's plus, that's right. Breathe-"}

[SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] Robert. [SPEAKER_02] Jolmier. Lier. Oh cool. This is a flying. [SPEAKER_00] What was that line? Yeah. Because I was a car mechanic and I saw something bad in the middle. [SPEAKER_00] Has it come to work? Well, I see. I mean, one of these two. Copycat. One of these two, he pulls three forward. Well, two rolls. Good point. [SPEAKER_00] I'm the [SPEAKER_01] don't you? [SPEAKER_01] How's the coffee at work? [SPEAKER_00] assumes the role that I see in the middle. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] I see in the middle. It gets a look before even the wear will do the other thing. So design. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] So does that mean we accept as a world? Good. Yeah, you could. You could. So I see. [SPEAKER_02] So I see. So you as the copycat saw a bad roll. Mm-hmm. Why did you say Robert? [SPEAKER_00] Why did you say robber? Because I'm trying to lie. [SPEAKER_00] Because we're like... [SPEAKER_01] Okay, well, I looked at him and he was a Tanner. So that's how it started. Who Rob and who Trouble made? Interesting. Interesting. It calls a... [SPEAKER_00] It calls a robber we can't trust a word he says. Why? Because he'd be stole from me as a chance to try to get killed, right? [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, well, let's just be honest, figure this out and know who to kill. Like adults. [SPEAKER_00] Let's just be on [SPEAKER_02] I can't look at the odds. We'll just, I don't want to be about this. We won't lie. [SPEAKER_02] Who's your up? I'm Rod from James and I can confirm he's this year. [SPEAKER_00] Convenient, get James on your side. So, oh, yeah, all right. [SPEAKER_02] I would like 95% conviction that Paul probably just robbed for you. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I am also on that. [SPEAKER_00] But why does it need... [SPEAKER_01] Drone below when a new challenge ends. [SPEAKER_00] So what do you do to Joe make? Uh, you're one of them. Nice. Thank you so much, friend. Thank you so much, friend. I can get a victory out of this round here. [SPEAKER_02] Thanks so much for that. [SPEAKER_00] So you were the Tantar to start? No, I was a crappy cat. I saw a bad card in the middle. No, you're a lot. You say you're throwing me him? Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] to start. No. [SPEAKER_01] You see you try. [SPEAKER_00] Excuse me. I just show them make them laugh. When do you, when do you from make after? That's goes last. [SPEAKER_01] When do you? [SPEAKER_02] After, it goes last, yeah. Everything, yeah. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] So let me think of how to get in and ask for a better review. [SPEAKER_00] They're both player-wolf you. That's why you should look in the middle not as another player as this year. Panicked. Panicked with your like four seconds to do something. Yeah. I believe that. [SPEAKER_02] I didn't rob from Justin, but I think he might actually be... [SPEAKER_02] A Werewolf? [SPEAKER_01] you're a Tanner, I know that, what if they're werewolves? [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] Which if they're willing to me, I don't want to tell you one of them [SPEAKER_01] ok [SPEAKER_00] one of them. No one wants to be a... Are we? [SPEAKER_01] I don't know, I'm gonna let it. I don't know where you're at. You're at 10 or what are you doing? [SPEAKER_00] WE B Downtown Mahoda [SPEAKER_00] I was a cop again, I saw Tanner or a werewolf in the center. [SPEAKER_02] What is is there an information? What if I just [SPEAKER_01] this. Don't look at that. We need to find out what was that. Now we'll show you what we're up for. How do you... [SPEAKER_00] We need to find out what was that? How was Eddie Ruff from How James? How can we figure it out? I think we just killed Paul. [SPEAKER_02] No? Okay, somebody here is lying, I haven't called them out yet, because I know something about. You wanna say? Yeah, you should. [SPEAKER_00] Because I have the information that I gave you, which was I was a copycat and I saw Tanner or Werewolf in the center of. I accurate, but. [SPEAKER_01] Damn it. [SPEAKER_01] interchangeable [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Oh, just tell me if I'm... [SPEAKER_01] Oh. [SPEAKER_01] Wait, maybe because if you have the top to cancel, I see before they rock. Okay. [SPEAKER_02] Because if you have the top two people, I see before they rock. Okay, so this is very interesting. I'm not the robber. No shit. The robber is in the center. How do you get? Because he's aware of it. Because I'm the seer. No! No! No! No! No! And this is why I thought- Oh, it's so tight. He's a stripping one. This is why I wanted to know. [SPEAKER_01] Hey, sit back. [SPEAKER_02] Ah, jeez. It's dope! [SPEAKER_01] He's so good So he's the tanner right now don't kill him [SPEAKER_02] Come on! Okay. Who do you think we should kill for? Probably fucking me. Who do you think we should kill? No? [SPEAKER_01] not Paul if you trouble made them because I was the guy that did just see her. [SPEAKER_02] I was the god [SPEAKER_00] Tuesday. Who was your start out. Tainor. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, so did you actually jump on that? Yeah, yeah, no, either you're a lot of it. I think Justin Rob James and his a werewolf. Because I think Justin, I think I was half a werewolf. He's a lot of it. [SPEAKER_00] So did you have to do it? Yeah? [SPEAKER_01] No, I just think either you're alive. I think, I think just... [SPEAKER_00] I think he's a lot. [SPEAKER_01] I think he's left. Yeah, we just vote left. So it's either, but if the werewolves don't get killed, they might be. So there might be a werewolf, I think, and I think I might be called, but I'm vote left. I have to be voting left. If I'm Tanner, it doesn't matter. So vote left. I'm vote left. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, but I so might be aware of what I think it might be called but [SPEAKER_02] I'm going to... [SPEAKER_02] Okay, we're voting left. If I'm Tanner, it doesn't matter. So, hold up.

And we have to see the whole snake before we can really draw the story. Well, thanks, Mitch. Yeah. So as it stands, this is what we're looking at. Correct. So, and you copy the trouble maker? Who did you chose, mate? The real problem though is that I, was actually the robber. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, I can get from the story. You know, that's, that's, you know, Mitchell was actually the seer. [SPEAKER_01] Last one. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, don't believe me, like if it was anyone fucking because I haven't been verified. Yeah, exactly. [SPEAKER_01] So the verification. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah.

Yeah me too 100% oh no that's fine we can both be mutual robber yeah sure we'll put it in the middle okay guys [SPEAKER_01] Okay guys [SPEAKER_00] I'll do that. Okay, but James, who did you rob if you robbed anyway? I definitely robbed James. Oh yeah, you robbed me and so I see you. I robbed him as a seer. What the fuck? Who do you trust more? The mission of the answer. Yeah, because you guys are both werewolves because I robbed a mission of the werewolf. I didn't wake up with you, did I? Is anybody cared? I didn't wake up with him. I mean, I would like to know if I was switched because I stole from Mitchell as a werewolf. I did switch you as somebody. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. It doesn't matter if you guys, if we find out, yeah, you were a tannic? No, I was a werewolf. You started as a werewolf? Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Definitely Rob James. [SPEAKER_01] Talk to you in the next video. [SPEAKER_01] Missed it!! [SPEAKER_01] That was how I'm going to work with [SPEAKER_01] I didn't wake up as a man. I would like to know if I was... [SPEAKER_01] All in. [SPEAKER_00] Oh. [SPEAKER_00] So who do you switch on? [SPEAKER_00] one of you too. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, fuck you options So what are you actually claiming to be robber rob from sear? Why just know I'm because you're lying Yeah, and talk to wear wolves in the center. Yes, I was a wear wolf Having seen two wearables, so like I'm already distressing the own sear that I definitely Being attacked by two people for being accused of lying because there's a car the cat who actually saw a wear wolf in there Oh, yeah, and a tan or trying to get killed. No, I got the trouble maker Did you know it's the card closest to him, so I believe him? I mean most people when it's like we'll get a car from the center I think instinctively go for the center most catcher I go I was I actually also switch that I always switch that never what I'm like I have to equally give each card place a turn [SPEAKER_01] I took him back for the EARP SHIN \ud0a4! [SPEAKER_01] You done all right? [SPEAKER_01] Why does no- because you're lying, no one's lying. [SPEAKER_01] This is a lot of laundry for having seen [SPEAKER_01] Definitely wrong, definitely. [SPEAKER_01] is crazy to wear walls [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Oh, no, I was switching to every coherence, Never. [SPEAKER_00] When they're going for Paul is that he did call out Trouble Maker without even hearing what your role was. Brave. It's very brave. Very brave. Brave for which, yeah. Brave for which. It's just what happened. Yeah man. Yeah. So you trouble made. [SPEAKER_01] Very, very, very... [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, man. Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Justin and somebody nice so how do we proceed so he's no claim robber you think I was where I was where oh yeah so he was canner [SPEAKER_01] Nice, so hard. [SPEAKER_01] it's [SPEAKER_01] You think I was where I was where I was where I was. Oh yeah, so he was. [SPEAKER_00] So either way it matters. It does matter. So how do we proceed? [SPEAKER_00] We could... Okay, let's just... We need to know who you're talking about. Yeah, at least pretend we don't find out. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, let's do this. We need to know who you're going to be. Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] for it. [SPEAKER_00] I think, Chaston. [SPEAKER_00] Puzzle can answer that because he knows who he's supposed to be. Like, start with... Who would you vote for? Yeah. I honestly don't know though, because like... It was love in this one. I don't trust any financial interest. I think they're both wearable. I don't know any financial interest. I was starting to not trust the seer that I wronged that. What? [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] \uc624\uc640. [SPEAKER_01] I don't trust any financial I think they're both where I don't know I was starting to not [SPEAKER_00] Why? [SPEAKER_00] I have to vote for you, you have to vote for me. Because we don't know who it was until it's cut. That sounds cute. So then you vote for Paul. Yeah, and then he votes for me. No, he votes for who the werewolf is. And none of us need to ask.

[SPEAKER_00] When I robbed the members, absolutely not true. Oh, why would you be lying? I made you good! [SPEAKER_01] Rob the robber's [SPEAKER_01] Oh. [SPEAKER_00] I made you a good guy! [SPEAKER_00] You're an actual crazy person. You're only actually nuts. [SPEAKER_00] That'll help me, I hope you guys find yourself here soon. [SPEAKER_00] Why would it hurt you to start it? I was a world. [SPEAKER_00] I knew it! What? Or you just started? I was a seer. And what did you see in the... I believe he's a TAN. What did you see in the next... I saw a... [SPEAKER_01] I thought we're all. [SPEAKER_01] Robert, that's what it was. [SPEAKER_01] Who do you want to go? [SPEAKER_00] for [SPEAKER_00] I don't even know. [SPEAKER_00] I want to vote for myself. Okay, he was a, I was a werewolf, I think he did rock for me. I think he's a werewolf now. I don't know who you swish for. And I do think he's a Tanner. He didn't wake up with me. I'm not telling you. [SPEAKER_01] Okay. [SPEAKER_01] especially if there's a tenor and two werewolves out here. No. Oh. I'm going to reach out. [SPEAKER_00] Oh, I'm going to read the James. Telling me something. [SPEAKER_01] Tell you what's up."}

[SPEAKER_01] Lets Go... [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] Who are the two werewolves? I'm gonna pause for a second. I will never believe a seer who looks at cards like this. So James is instantly out in my mind. Oh my god. [SPEAKER_02] James is instantly out in my mind 100% look at two cards in the center like this 100% like this I am I always said you always look at the center card and yeah like I am and look at [SPEAKER_01] What is it? [SPEAKER_01] and looked at everything but I know nobody especially because my rules [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] That's a horse shit grass. I trust you to literally end of the earth. That's a horse shit grass that he said. These two five-year-old. I trust you 100% James. I think these two guys are werewolves. I think you're right. It could be a town, I don't know. You guys woke up together. You do want to claim troublemaker. And that's a horse shit poll at something that's irrelevant to the game because he has no way to do bunker information. I agree. How do we claim to be troublemaker? How do we pass this? You were trying to because I was a whole new, not asking you what you were doing at that time. No, no, you were like trying to get it. Because you were holding it. Yeah, he was trying to get it. See, they're werewolves, man. Yeah, you can kill us. Let's kill them. Shut it up. [SPEAKER_01] I took the...! [SPEAKER_01] I agree. How do we claim to be children? How do we... Bud passes? You were trying... [SPEAKER_01] That's not what you were doing with that. No, no, you were... [SPEAKER_00] with that. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, he was trying to get us in. [SPEAKER_02] Let's go to vote. [SPEAKER_01] Come on, don't just go do we not just get over why we had talked us out. Oh, we just did you did [SPEAKER_01] a Voyager old [SPEAKER_02] It's wearable. [SPEAKER_01] Swirl, okay? [SPEAKER_01] Does somebody read? Probably maker. Nooooooo! Okay. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] I swear to god if you don't vote Paul with me, we'll be very upset. So, okay. [SPEAKER_01] Uh, they're... I don't know if he was going to pal. [SPEAKER_02] How do you feel about that? [SPEAKER_01] He's trying to trip us. I think so too. Yeah. Football. How dare I try to play the game? Yeah, exactly. Let's see. Let's see if I can play the game. Let's see if we can do a fairly vote. [SPEAKER_02] He's trying. [SPEAKER_02] We're gonna find them and we're gonna do a terribly boat. [SPEAKER_01] No, we made that mistake once. Yeah, that was really bad. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, that was really bad. Well, you guys, if the information's out there, we're prolonging your game. [SPEAKER_01] Thank you. [SPEAKER_02] If you're not... [SPEAKER_01] Cool, isn't early about, do you mind giving some info? [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I figured it out. No one can say I could go to give. I figured it out. [SPEAKER_01] mount it in and how itHAN will go to game. [SPEAKER_02] This is very interesting. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, that's what you do. [SPEAKER_01] You don't have to believe me. That's fine. Yeah. 100% will do it, James. [SPEAKER_02] You don't have to go see Trump. [SPEAKER_00] You don't have to. [SPEAKER_02] believe me that's fine. [SPEAKER_02] We'll do it, James. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, trail makers right there. Yeah, no doubt, Nurtis. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, no doubt, no, you see. The audacity of playing this game. Isn't it really, Michelle? [SPEAKER_01] The rabbit's name is actually Robert. Yeah, named after us. Playing board games. Named after us, the Robert. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I'm okay with going to a vote.

[SPEAKER_00] But I need to hear from everyone else first. Tell me the last. I have a friend Justin. Nice. Who's the CR? We saw what they did and we said, let's try that out. [SPEAKER_01] It's not that embarrassing. [SPEAKER_01] We saw what [SPEAKER_00] So let's pretend that that's true. Cool. That's not true. How can we leverage that? How can we... Mitch, does that mean you're the troll wanker? Potentially. I mean, I know you are. What do you do? Yeah. Sick. I now trust you. So here's what I think happened, buddy. You... as either the werewolf or the copycat. Saw a werewolf here, didn't you? [SPEAKER_01] Now trust you so here's what I think happened buddy [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Man, so this is what I think happened. I think... [SPEAKER_00] that happened. [SPEAKER_00] I can tell you this much, Ches. So then did you switch him? And if you say it was so short with the may, I'm going to do it. No, did someone rob from me first? No, he robbed from me. No, I'm not. Just looking at this. I give it. Tell you how do you know that this is this? I looked at these two because I was like, what's literally do with James did? And it felt good. Oh my gosh, okay. [SPEAKER_01] Okay Rob. [SPEAKER_01] \u54c8\u56c9 [SPEAKER_00] The power Yeah, I did not swap James with anyone Oh, sick sick really yeah, so we can just kill him and play one more tiny round No, no no [SPEAKER_01] You didn't stand... [SPEAKER_01] Oh, these are two baby rooms. No, no, no. [SPEAKER_00] Is there any chance that Mitchell is a... A copycat werewolf potentially, but I don't think James would have won on that lie. Oh yeah, because you saw the werewolf in the middle. Yeah, I saw the werewolf in the tanor, so I don't think Mitch is lying. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Would you swap? Would you swap? You didn't see the copycat. These two. [SPEAKER_01] The crack is predominance. [SPEAKER_01] I saw the wherewith and the [SPEAKER_01] Okay, okay, we're going to do this. [SPEAKER_01] V2. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, if Mitch was the copycat, where will he wouldn't say that he switched us? Correct. Hold on. [SPEAKER_00] You switched. [SPEAKER_00] to my rich choice one. Come up with a strategy. Yeah, you got it. Not been there. Yeah, that was a blast round. Both of us like, I've been there. What are we doing? Okay, I can figure this out. Yep. [SPEAKER_00] Yep, um, yep. I was aware of I was alone. [SPEAKER_00] He's bigger than the actual truth. [SPEAKER_00] I saw a werewolf in a tanner. You saw a werewolf in a tanner, so that checks out. Sometimes it plays. So Mitchell played you too. So that's interaction from only other interaction in this game that could have happened. [SPEAKER_01] That's the International Rob Bones. [SPEAKER_00] Paul could run from me. Paul ran from me and then you're the werewolf. Oh, then I'm okay with still voting for you. If that's the case. Yeah, I guess Paul technically could have done that. Yeah, but in that case, I'm the werewolf and I'm okay with voting for you. So we have to do that. Did you run from me? Oh, this is interesting. Because if I run, then I have to. You're good and we are. He could be bad. Nice. I run from James. Did you have to vote for Justin? You got him. I mean, can we still kill James? At the same time. We can't be able to vote for Justin. That's an actual killed James. No, so what we should do is you two vote for me. You and me vote for him. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Nice chance! [SPEAKER_01] This is interesting. [SPEAKER_01] You're a... [SPEAKER_01] \u06cc\u06c1eise devices [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] so we have over the limit, let's jump into an actual level [SPEAKER_01] No, I thought I knew what we should do is you to- [SPEAKER_00] Sure. I think that's totally fair. Just in case this didn't happen. So, for us? No, because a village is when if a werewolf dies. Yes, so I'm totally okay with this. So, I was kidding. I'm voting for you. Oh. No reason to vote for James. I got a vote for you. Yeah. I just is scary. I know who I robbed from. So you were okay though. Well, you were a werewolf at any time. But legitimately. Yeah. Yeah. I got a vote for you. Go for it. No. No, because I was the werewolf. Oh, yeah, no, that's the thing. That's all right. Should have been like this. [SPEAKER_01] Just in case this didn't happen. Yeah, no. [SPEAKER_01] Yes, so I'm on tour. [SPEAKER_01] I'm kidding. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] I know who I robbed from. Sir, I can't help but you will always have any talent. Pagitimately. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, no, that's today, I-I-I-sorry. [SPEAKER_00] So... [SPEAKER_00] No, no, so he... Good stride, you get like full... Yeah, I'm okay with dying. I'm just saying we should kill James too. Such honorable death. Like, I don't do what's the downside of all this in the James. Maybe he's the Tanner, and we can kill him there too. But he's not, I'm the Tanner. [SPEAKER_00] Uh, you have some more vote for somebody else then, won't you? No, I'm gonna vote for James. Because I think he's still a werewolf, and I'm gonna kill him. [SPEAKER_01] No, I'm gonna vote for James. [SPEAKER_00] If you started this, it's funny for just saying, yeah, for you, the world of love. [SPEAKER_01] If you started this, that's for just saying, yeah, for you, the world. [SPEAKER_00] Because the cop cat world has to wake up as a werewolf. There is no cop cat world from this game. Just the rules. Yeah. Yeah, okay. So I didn't see it. Okay, okay. Okay. Oh, okay, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So we can't wait all right? I guess. [SPEAKER_01] Because it's a cop cat where all has to wake up as a [SPEAKER_01] Just the rules. Yeah, yeah, okay, so I didn't see it. Okay. Okay."}

[SPEAKER_01] That's also a werewolf. Just in case anybody can't. There's only one werewolf over there. Okay. I'll just move you. I swish with you, Atlanta. Okay, so that makes me the werewolf. Yes, yes. Yeah, it's murder death me. Alright, death me. I will either of them. Oh no. No, I just have to be out of drugs. That's true. Mitchell went. Okay, so are we? Yeah. So that makes me the werewolf, right? Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Just in case anybody can't. There's only one world over there. Okay. Okay. [SPEAKER_00] Yes. [SPEAKER_00] Bye.

[SPEAKER_01] in which case she would have gone back. It would have gone back. Oh, okay. Strategy. If this is correct, it might not be correct. Well, yeah, you could be lying, but it's in your best interest to kill the werewolves. It's a clear wake up. Because they could both be werewolves and play a very nice game of going to the pinning on you now. Oh, yeah, right. No, well, no, well, no, because I switched with him. Or you robbed him, original. Oh, yeah. So that she would be a werewolf. Yeah. So there really is only one werewolf. Yeah. And logically, it's me. And it's the worst ever when you're a werewolf. And you pick up the werewolf car. Yeah, that's. Fuck. Now what? Now what? Which is me, somebody. All right. All right. I knew you saw. [SPEAKER_00] I see what it comes back. It would have come back. It would have come back.

So okay, so you guys are taking... [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Yeah! Now he's the seeker. So, okay, you guys are claiming you just swapped. Yes. Interesting. He's confirming my story, so that's good. Alright. [SPEAKER_02] Yes, interesting. He's gonna throw it away. [SPEAKER_03] Can you come for my story? [SPEAKER_03] Ah! [SPEAKER_01] I mean not 100% but indirectly maybe. Indirectly? I did not see a robber anywhere else. Sure, okay. So that worked. [SPEAKER_03] Cool? That's cool? Yeah. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_03] So what are you two werewolves? [SPEAKER_01] You two were all so happy to play by person. So I'm just gonna sit back for a minute. I'm really strategized. What do you think you are? No. No. You look to mind then. No. No, he's not drunk in the middle. He's not drunk in the center. Did you too? [SPEAKER_02] C\u1ea3m \u01a1n  your corpse, \u0111\u00e0oae [SPEAKER_02] Thank you too. [SPEAKER_03] Is that your little whale or is she's a Tanner? [SPEAKER_02] Hello [SPEAKER_03] No, that's a go-to one for Tanner because this is already a risk. [SPEAKER_02] It's true. It's very true. I did see drunken in the center. [SPEAKER_03] Right now you've cut the button off of the screen grab it [SPEAKER_02] 100% sawed directly to the center. [SPEAKER_01] So you're now not claiming to be the drunk, you're claiming to be the town. Oh so she's the where- [SPEAKER_03] Oh, she's the werewolf and this is the one who wants us to vote for her. [SPEAKER_03] or she's double tanning me right now. Heads gonna blow up. [SPEAKER_03] Okay, so we have two people coming to be Tanner! [SPEAKER_00] So we are making Russian news. [SPEAKER_02] If you hit the text zero. [SPEAKER_03] My life is in ruins. I don't even want to- [SPEAKER_02] Only one of them is a werewolf because I saw a werewolf in the center. All right. [SPEAKER_03] We got one where we'll go. So you guys are, wait, it's not only us. You guys are on different teams here. No, no. [SPEAKER_02] like vloggers, if you would? [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] No, no, they're not. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] No, we're- Cause what- You're the only one who's been here. You're the only one who's been here. You're the only one who's been here. You're the only one who's been here. You're the only one who's been here. You're the only one who's been here. You're the only one who's been here. You're the only one who's been here.

[SPEAKER_01] wants to be killed. [SPEAKER_02] What if one of us does it? If the Tanner gets killed, the wearer will still win because they weren't killed. It could join victory. [SPEAKER_03] It's a joint victory. [SPEAKER_02] So they're on the same team right now. We here trying to figure out if we kill them. [SPEAKER_03] If we kill the where we'll the Tanner loses the [SPEAKER_02] the terror loses and we win. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, so you want to kill the werewolf and not the Tanner? Yep. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] If we kill the Tanner, then everyone loses, except for the Tanner. I- I don't know. Where I'm still with, I believe. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, if you kill a Tanner, the way I will say to live, the Tanner Diet or the way I will say to live, the Tanner Diet. [SPEAKER_02] That road.... Trucks [SPEAKER_02] double check the Tanner hates his job so much that he wants to die. [SPEAKER_03] It's like it's not in. [SPEAKER_01] So you get me in my third game and I'm all so strategist. The Tanner adds a lot of complexity. Yeah, I like it. OK. [SPEAKER_03] Okay, I think Kaitlyn is the world wolf, Atlanta's the tanner. [SPEAKER_03] What do we think?

[SPEAKER_01] Yeah, so it doesn't matter what you do So but he robbed and then you trouble made him with Atlanta Okay, so that makes okay, so I was I was I'm the drunk, but I'll have the drunk card you still did the action [SPEAKER_00] So [SPEAKER_00] So, but here- [SPEAKER_00] Oh right okay, okay yeah [SPEAKER_01] Okay, so you 100% wish us. [SPEAKER_01] You looked at my card? Yeah. Well, you didn't look at my card because that's a popular one. You're up for me! No, no, I'm a Tanner. What? So now this switch, Tanner's not, you're the werewolf because you just lied about what I actually had. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] I did not follow any of you. I was distracted by the very loud noises that have been done. I was. [SPEAKER_01] I was the Tanner that's the whole time. No, I was. I don't know. I was trying to feel it. He's the wearable. I didn't know what to say. I was the Tanner. No, no, no. He's trying to put it on you. He doesn't want to get votes anymore. But you're not, you're good. [SPEAKER_00] I was trying to feel he's the wearable. [SPEAKER_00] the world. [SPEAKER_00] I have no idea. Are you following us? [SPEAKER_01] No, he knows she could still be aware of it. [SPEAKER_01] 100% could still be worth. I was 100% the Tanner [SPEAKER_00] No you were. I was the Tanner. Yeah, we were the T. It wouldn't have done any difference. I would have done that. You would have switched to something different. [SPEAKER_01] No you weren't. I was the Tanner. Yeah. We'll see you too. We'll see you soon. But it wouldn't. [SPEAKER_01] that and you would switch with something with the center. So you could still potentially be the werewolf, but I 100% think matches the werewolf. I'm 100% positive, he was the werewolf to begin with. No, because he lied and I could try to confirm it and he's just like, yeah, I looked at your card. Yeah, I looked at your card. [SPEAKER_01] No, you did no I was I asked you twice you know you are the [SPEAKER_00] I got a point out the amazing comment here. Hi, my chaser shovel, please continue digging. [SPEAKER_01] Shut up chat. Did they have wood this last time? No I didn't. I did it. You. They did not have wood. Okay. He was a werewolf. No you're a werewolf. I was a hunter. That's very scary. I was a hundred percent the Tanner. [SPEAKER_00] Thank you. That's enough of you. [SPEAKER_00] I was a hunter, that's very scary. [SPEAKER_01] You said I switched, I'm coming out as what I was. If you had said I switched, I would have come out as where was I? I was a Tanner to begin with. Oh no, he's a little bit of a boss. And I had no information to work with last night because I didn't wake up. Guys, we have to vote for Atlanta. I think we have to vote for Atlanta. No, I'm not saying we have to vote for Mitch. I think we have to vote for Atlanta. They're voting for you. I know good that we have to vote for Mitch. No, you can't vote for me because you have to vote for one of those two.

I'm right at the least. If there's a twin bigger on the table, they'd not be anymore if he claims to not have been moved. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] You know, it could too happen. I'll explain. [SPEAKER_01] BurRE [SPEAKER_02] Okay, so there is some serious horse play going on. [SPEAKER_03] Absolutely. [SPEAKER_02] serious horseplay because the werewolf was you. [SPEAKER_02] So... [SPEAKER_01] So [SPEAKER_01] Okay, so she was a lone werewolf, she looked in the middle, she saw a trouble maker. So she's like, yeah, I'm gonna take trouble maker. Meanwhile, Tanner over there is like, I'm gonna pick a random hole. I'm in the Soviet. It was me, I'm in the Soviet. [SPEAKER_01] 100% I was the insomniac. No, then what'd you wake up at? [SPEAKER_01] I actually woke up as the seer. Get out of town. Okay. Oh, so double wear wolf then. Double wear wolf. You guys are working together. 100% I was standing. I woke up as the seer. So I got switched in the night. [SPEAKER_03] Dovefrostin [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] So either there's a rubber or a tunnel maker out or there's some serious line going on. [SPEAKER_01] No, it has to be trouble maker, Robert. Couldn't switch our hearts. But you know that there wasn't a trouble maker, right? [SPEAKER_02] But you know that that wasn't [SPEAKER_02] She did not have a child maker when I was open. Fantastic. [SPEAKER_01] So there wasn't a troublemaker that not only a she-lie, but he's also a lie. [SPEAKER_01] I don't know who is the trouble maker, but I was inside of the guy who woke up yesterday. [SPEAKER_03] I can confirm that story. Oh, pooh! [SPEAKER_01] These guys are confirming each other's story left and right. We've got two werewolves on her neck. They just keep on getting a tanner, but I think they just see. It gets really, really upset when he's the waltz. Absolutely upset when he's the waltz. [SPEAKER_00] I can't do it. I can't do it. [SPEAKER_03] We get really really upset when we just go out. Absolutely upset when we just go out. We have 7, he's the devil. And it's not going his way. It's not going his way. It's not going his way. He's the harbour. [SPEAKER_01] And it's not going his way. It's not going his way. It's the hard work. And I just woke up and saw me out. No, he's the where we'll. [SPEAKER_02] Alright guys, it's March That's my man [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Okay, well I'm definitely not being soggy. No. I am. I'm a prime type of me. [SPEAKER_01] I believe that you're the seer. [SPEAKER_02] I-I-I-I-what is this here? [SPEAKER_01] Yes. [SPEAKER_01] I think I think I think I [SPEAKER_02] I think we saw makers out there, we have a troll maker, but you saw where we're at. I saw where we're at there. [SPEAKER_01] But you saw where we're all. [SPEAKER_01] And even if there was another trouble making it. No, maybe. [SPEAKER_01] No, oh, maybe. What, baby? Did you just want me to birth with her? No, I didn't. I picked it up and then I dropped it. I didn't mean to. Baby, baby. Baby, we'll take this role now. Well, maybe they're both werewolves. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_01] Well, you and I both know that's not true. [SPEAKER_02] I don't know that's not true. Yeah, I'm not but okay. She let's listen on it on the air just to cover your bases. Are these two? [SPEAKER_01] Alright, these two, I need you both to say something bad about the other person so I know you're not teaming in two little werewolves. The only one reason why she might not be a trouble maker, go. [SPEAKER_02] The aim on reason why she might not be a- [SPEAKER_02] Whoa, we just have to get one wearable. That's all that's gonna happen. [SPEAKER_01] because you might be the troublemaker. No, the best reason is because she is the seer. And you are ignoring that fact. So you're on her team. No. [SPEAKER_01] I'm not ignoring that, man. I'm stressed drinking right now. [SPEAKER_02] I was smart. I just bring a drink with me. There's all kinds of water. Oh, I have a little polymer over there. [SPEAKER_03] Why don't you sit the water? [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] We absolutely have to vote for Kayla. I am so confident in her. She's the world, and you're defending the crap out of her. We're defending. [SPEAKER_02] This is so classic now. She's the world\u043b\u0443\u0447ally inch, he's really r\u00e9sult... [SPEAKER_00] the world. [SPEAKER_02] we have. [SPEAKER_02] Well, we're Carla's hold on. So she was aware of what before and now she's playing for the 12-Maker. Either way, she's still aware of what she's going to move to her own car. Yes. Because the fuller wear will pull just kill her. Yes. [SPEAKER_00] Yes. And then move your own car. Yes. [SPEAKER_01] I'm so sorry. Unless you want to change to a robber there Mike, then maybe you see it. How many of you are wrong, you know what I said to you? I've only climbed one here. I only climbed one here. And it's in Somia. I'm stressed right here enough. Thanks the Cody Lackie. Sorry. Sorry. [SPEAKER_03] I don't know the exclamation point. It's okay. [SPEAKER_02] Okay.

[SPEAKER_00] He did do that thing where he takes a role and then like [SPEAKER_00] But he was really sure about my coffee in your practice. Yeah, he was really sure. But he also... And all my rules, when this round before... Before, until now. You know what? He didn't say anything beforehand. That's why I think he might be the werewolf. No, I was the werewolf. You don't think that the switch egg... Like his Haiti. It happened. You robbed from me. She's the werewolf. We killed Caitlyn. [SPEAKER_01] Let's get it. [SPEAKER_01] Anton Nick no [SPEAKER_01] more head. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] Sure. Nobody do you think App and Justin, tell me a story. I don't know. Like, I have very little to go on. That's why I'm not talking here. [SPEAKER_00] You switch to this too? Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Go I'm Haiti. Yep, we saw that joke right here. [SPEAKER_00] Oh my god, we have to kill one of them, but I don't know which one. [SPEAKER_00] Because if Kaelin robbed, for me, I don't care. One minute. But she wouldn't be acting coy about this, if there was a switch. Which makes she think she does rob from, she did frog from Mike and now we have a... [SPEAKER_00] There's a Tanner. I don't think Mike was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_00] I was a little I saw the Tanner on Mike. No. And Mike has it back if Mike and Doug suggest. Nope. [SPEAKER_01] That was awful.

I've said, I have other double wearables in there playing us. I was just killing. I was just killing two coins. I think both are killing. I feel alone, guys. We both are killing. Oh.

Yeah, but still, I'd want to hear the stories you guys each make to see even further, right? [SPEAKER_01] I love what you're like. [SPEAKER_01] No, because we know. [SPEAKER_00] But here's the thing, you both know which of the other two is lying. Right. So you and all we all know, but we should still talk through everything. Probably. Because this is how we can... So we all have the same memory as you. We're just saying it out loud. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] You [SPEAKER_00] That's why we have to take a step further to see who's better at playing with their fake potential information. And the fact that you don't want to talk. I don't want to talk. Alright, well let's start with Megan, she went first. [SPEAKER_00] Wait, wait, Mike just said you would talk and now you're like, let's go on a turn order. Great, great, great. Alright, what did you see in the middle? I saw Mike's roll in the middle. Spicy. Great. Alright, so then what did you do during the troublemaker phase? Oh, that's too much information, Cheryl. Sure, alright, Mike. What did you do? I switched Megan and Caitlin. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Right here. [SPEAKER_01] Sure. [SPEAKER_00] Alright. [SPEAKER_00] That's rough. [SPEAKER_00] That's rough news for somebody at this table. [SPEAKER_00] So what else happened guys? [SPEAKER_00] So now... [SPEAKER_00] You know what, I'm not gonna talk. I'm gonna let someone else deduce what the best course of action is, because I know, but I don't want to say it. Justin? Yeah. What did you do? Yeah. You're doing a lot of talking things. I think he's not sharing his information. I think the implication of the fact that I told you, you and I both know who was lying. Yeah. And then also the fact that I reacted to one of the actions and not the other implies heavily what I did during that. That's true. That's true. So you ran from Megan. I did not run from Megan. No, I think you ran from me. I ran from Mike, Mike is telling the truth. [SPEAKER_01] That's it. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, you're doing a lot of texting. I'm not sh- [SPEAKER_01] That's true. [SPEAKER_00] and you should know that too. [SPEAKER_00] because you saw a copy count in the center. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Thanks. [SPEAKER_00] But whatever Megan was, you are now. Cool. [SPEAKER_00] For realsies? For realsies. [SPEAKER_01] for real things. [SPEAKER_00] Realies? Yeah. She's what I was. I mean, I don't know. I can't confirm that Mike was a troublemaker. I can't confirm his action. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. She's what I- [SPEAKER_00] Here we don't kill people. She's dead. [SPEAKER_00] So no one dies tonight? We should probably kill Megan. [SPEAKER_01] The wasting time, vissa around [SPEAKER_00] No! I'm not explaining why you're wrong. Didn't believe, I asked why you didn't believe me. [SPEAKER_00] That's funny. Were you a regular? Where were we? And you saw Princess here in the middle? I saw the coffee cap there. Coffee cap in the middle. I took a guess. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, I love you! [SPEAKER_00] What would you guys say if I told you that she is now riding on her fellow wear wolf? No, because you didn't stick her thumb up. It doesn't matter, we killed one of you, which we for sure just killed you anyway. And you couldn't have been the copycat because I saw the copycat in the center. I definitely was. It was a copycat. Did not stick your thumb up. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I definitely was the copycat. [SPEAKER_00] I love you. What are you doing this to me? Why why it's a loss for me either way. I'm fucking Tanner now [SPEAKER_00] Kill me. Go for it. Okay. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, she gave the approval"}

[SPEAKER_00] Did you actually switch us? [SPEAKER_02] \u015e,\ub788\uc5b4 [SPEAKER_02] Alright Mike, I'm gonna ask you for all the information before Mitchell and I give up any. Oh. [SPEAKER_02] What is one roll? You did not see in the center. [SPEAKER_01] What? What? What? [SPEAKER_01] I did not see a werewolf. [SPEAKER_02] I don't believe that for a second. Oh, okay. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] I rest my case. Vote now. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Why don't you believe me? Who are they, don't believe me? [SPEAKER_02] I don't need to prove anything. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No, we have a kangaroo cord here. We can just hang whatever we want here. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Um [SPEAKER_02] Paul, we have a slight problem. We don't. I was gonna say there's a slight problem with this. Oh, spicy bar, you're a robber? I know. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I was trying to give you their eye contact. I know, I saw that. I wanted us to have it as just a moment before. Let's do it. [SPEAKER_00] This is J\u30d0. [SPEAKER_01] I kind of hahaha [SPEAKER_01] nice back to you,ARROTS! [SPEAKER_02] Alright, so Mitch is saying he's the robbery, saying he stole from me? Nope. Paul. [SPEAKER_01] No. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, you stole from me. That's really funny because I stole from Justin that's how I know he's a trollmaker because I started a robber but like Well, we can grow with that. Okay [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] What an interesting turn of events. Oh! [SPEAKER_01] Oh, let's hand-hand. Or, let's see or see. That doesn't make any sense. [SPEAKER_02] Leach's- Deach their own paul. And we're like, why would he- He eats their own- [SPEAKER_01] Okay, oh, and you're each bed. I'll each mile [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] I'm rich. [SPEAKER_01] Prove that. [SPEAKER_02] I'm going to say I may or may not have interacted with your card. [SPEAKER_01] Whoa! That changes everything! Does anyone- [SPEAKER_02] Does anyone care if I throw them in or real cave in the tunnel? [SPEAKER_01] I care if you trouble me with Mitch, because I think I'm gonna need to probably die. [SPEAKER_02] Alright, my whiff of small problem here. Because. [SPEAKER_02] I asked what did you not see in the center and you said you saw no werewolves but as the seer you would have seen a werewolf so [SPEAKER_01] So that's so I didn't want to give away that I it's all the serum So as the cubby cat I didn't want to see where wolves Look at the sea. I saw where wolves [SPEAKER_02] Okay, has the series. [SPEAKER_02] That's a lot of hooy. Okay! [SPEAKER_02] Okay, so really, we have kind of nothing really to go on, huh? Like, you guys are both saying the same thing, so there's a conflict there, which is interesting. I put... [SPEAKER_01] Thank you. [SPEAKER_01] which is interesting. I put the troublemaker on your thing. So I think you could probably trust me. [SPEAKER_02] I mean, I trust both of you, but as far as I can trust you. [SPEAKER_02] Um. [SPEAKER_02] And then Mike is saying there's no werewolf. I mean, with this not logic you have, are you concerned about what's happening here? [SPEAKER_00] And then Mike is saying [SPEAKER_01] No, I think one of those is the Tanner and just playing it up, trying to get the votes on them. [SPEAKER_01] Like you think I'm trying to get votes on me right now. No, I think bitches. Okay. Thank you. I mean I'm the robber and [SPEAKER_02] robbed you. What was that? I've weirdly got the robber. [SPEAKER_02] So I'm just as confused as you are. That is a bit of a strange thing, but I believe that that could happen one out of every a million games one time. [SPEAKER_00] Just as confused as you are. That is a bit of a strange thing, but I believe that that could happen. [SPEAKER_01] man [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Well we've played about that many. That's a fucking good lie. [SPEAKER_01] I got the fucking robber. I have the robber. Yeah. Because it's only one role you got to lie about now. Fucking smart. [SPEAKER_02] Alright, well, Mike, I didn't switch you with one of them. [SPEAKER_02] No, but are you not concerned that maybe you are now wanting to resume the line? And you would have a different day. [SPEAKER_01] You are now me, one of the reasons. [SPEAKER_01] I mean, I'd be concerned if I was the Tanner now. [SPEAKER_02] Alright, so let's play if you're the Tanner. Do you want to die? Well, yeah, do you want to die? I do want to die. [SPEAKER_01] Well, yeah, I do want to die. I do want to die then, but I don't know. Who are we voting for? [SPEAKER_01] We're running out of time quickly. Just years was up. If you swish me with Mitch, then I hope you vote for me because I think Mitch is the channeler. If you swish me with Mike, then I hope you don't vote for me because I think there's a chance Mike could be bad or he could be good either way. I don't want to die. So do we vote for whoever's owed just to you? You give them and then I will just be at the mercy of you. Yeah. Or I vote for Justin because fuck this. I vote for him. [SPEAKER_02] So do we vote for whoever goes against the government? [SPEAKER_00] and then I- [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I don't think it matters who the switch was. [SPEAKER_01] going for Paul, if it matters. I'm voting for not Mitch. [SPEAKER_02] I'm gonna vote for Paul. I don't vote for Paul. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] because you're the one that I switched Mike with. Okay. And Mike's the person I actually trust the least right. [SPEAKER_01] Okay. [SPEAKER_01] I'm like honestly with you on that. [SPEAKER_01] You know what, Justin? Yeah! [SPEAKER_00] "}

Like, I know that can't happen with this. Many people are like, what are they doing? It's good. [SPEAKER_02] It could if the compi-cat saw the rover then took a werewolf. [SPEAKER_02] We're all thinking so hard about this. [SPEAKER_01] I can hear all three of our brains just I couldn't hear my brain. And I was just blank. It was like you had a title in it. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I was a deer in headlight small. Yeah, we killed a minute. Great job if you're aware of all. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Alright that was dozens rose Justin. [SPEAKER_01] Alright, I was a trouble worker. Justin started that he's a morover. [SPEAKER_02] I was drooling the maker and I believe that I believe so. [SPEAKER_01] I believe I believe I do. [SPEAKER_01] And it robbed for me. Nice. [SPEAKER_01] It wasn't pretty. Kay, well you know what? Fuck it. [SPEAKER_01] You just want to punch me around. I hope. [SPEAKER_02] I hope. I hope. [SPEAKER_01] It was really good like tones. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I'm not pretty. It wasn't a nice situation for me. Did you actually look at the tail of the stove? Maybe. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I got to say it's not pretty. It's not crazy. [SPEAKER_02] Well, you'd be rest assured that you are not what you started in. Which... [SPEAKER_01] Which one did you look at? Because I looked at one in the center. [SPEAKER_01] But I'm not what I started at. [SPEAKER_01] Which one did you look at? I don't know. No, I'm not gonna say that. I guys say sound. Fuck off. Which one did you guys get to sound? [SPEAKER_02] No, I'm gonna stay sound. Fuck off, which one do you guys go sound? [SPEAKER_01] I'm gonna say this I don't want. [SPEAKER_01] Thank you. [SPEAKER_01] maybe you're on over here. [SPEAKER_01] Keep a way, who are you? No, I'm just... I don't know about if Justin's with you, Mitchell. [SPEAKER_01] I brought from Desson and let's see which way with somebody just which me Mitchell in my town [SPEAKER_02] and let's see which we will sum. [SPEAKER_01] Did you reveal yours or did he reveal yours? I reveal mine. He did, it's true. [SPEAKER_02] but he took so you might not have robbed from him but he might have robbed from all here's my son [SPEAKER_01] Here's my dog from Paul. Here's my son. No, no, wait, here's my son. When Paul took troublemaker, I gave Justin a look. And then when Justin put his thing in. Look, ah. It proved that he didn't know shit about you. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] I mean, you don't need to because I know about me and the fact that you don't believe me means you're a threat Okay, I'm not ready to vote yet [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] Okay, we'll now look at what that check. [SPEAKER_01] Oh, you know what, that checks out, but... No, I-I-I-Hunder is that a rough test. It had? Yeah, we both believe in Mike. [SPEAKER_01] das. [SPEAKER_01] Well, if you're not gonna say that who you switch with, I think my best bet is to vote for you, because then I'm probably, if I'm still aware of all of... [SPEAKER_02] BaliatoryA [SPEAKER_01] you are. [SPEAKER_01] What? [SPEAKER_02] This is what's in the world. [SPEAKER_02] Like, which is the dinner? Feel a lot of going on with that. What's up? [SPEAKER_01] What's up? [SPEAKER_02] What's with these? Did you start as a war wolf? [SPEAKER_01] Correct! [SPEAKER_02] Can I still do a wake up a lot? [SPEAKER_02] Ingram. Oh, spicy boar. [SPEAKER_01] Who's so fucking confused? Like, I don't know what your play is here. You, unless you start as the Tanner. [SPEAKER_01] Or I guess if you copy-catted it to Tanner. Who just went that way. I think I'm gonna vote for Justin, because I think I'm probably... [SPEAKER_01] Tanner or Werewolf or Robert just remains. So we just need to, okay, he's told from one of us. He's told from one of us and I'm paused. I'm told from just one. And then he mixed up someone. So that means out of the three of us, two of us are Werewolves. I know. We don't know which ones we are. I mean, it does Justin switch me. I vote, but I think we vote for Justin, all three of us. [SPEAKER_02] yeah [SPEAKER_02] So we just need to kill him. He's just need to kill him. Where is Frizz? [SPEAKER_02] We don't know which ones we are. [SPEAKER_02] That means one of you guys will lose the game. Correct. Yes. [SPEAKER_01] Correct. Yes. In terms of 66% chance you will win. [SPEAKER_01] No, I think... [SPEAKER_00] only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_02] I actually didn't switch you. [SPEAKER_02] \u53ef\u4ee5\u793e\u7fa4\u7db2\u8ab24 [SPEAKER_01] Okay, so shall we get Paul? Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] So Mitch is still Tanner, unless my grob from him. No, no, I brought from you, your back to where we'll begin. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] If he's telling the truth, or we all vote just then. [SPEAKER_02] Everything is closed! [SPEAKER_02] No, I'm vod over pa. I'll kill pa. [SPEAKER_01] I guess I vote for Justin Pimpsoware Wolf. He's fucking with you, Mike. No. Vote for Justin. I said my dream is up. Everyone. [SPEAKER_00] I said my dream was up, everyone.

How do you promote burda? [SPEAKER_01] I can actually confirm a story because I wrote from him he is the copycat so it's like why is what I would like to know [SPEAKER_02] Bye! [SPEAKER_02] Alright, okay. [SPEAKER_02] Why did you point at the one, why? That's a good thing to do in this game. Which one did you look at? Which card? Shibum. I loved it though. Wow. He's lying though. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, he's lying though. So you've been confirmed my story that? Maybe. [SPEAKER_01] I'd like you to give her a burst. [SPEAKER_02] confirmed. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] That's it. I feel like at this point it's very imperative if you tell us what you did and you tell the truth. Okay, I'm not- Okay, I'm not- [SPEAKER_02] I'm not gonna do that. Well, it's only four minutes away a little bit. We're gonna bullshit for a bit. [SPEAKER_01] Come on, everybody's given some, just give it, okay, can we have your roll? [SPEAKER_02] You know what it is? I know what it is. Let's just stay there. [SPEAKER_01] I'm not there. Can I? [SPEAKER_02] I'm not good at it. Well, what's in these 40, I think I'm gonna clear. [SPEAKER_02] Good call. That was trouble maker. [SPEAKER_01] Okay. [SPEAKER_01] So I saw one of your roles. [SPEAKER_01] This is so weird. This is so weird. [SPEAKER_01] y'all are playing me good on this one [SPEAKER_02] What do you mean? [SPEAKER_02] I have told nothing but the truth. I think... [SPEAKER_01] I think you haven't told You just de-confirmed Conferred [SPEAKER_02] Deconferment, Conferment, Conferment, Conferment. Well that's because, I mean Mitch knows I'm on the level. Mitch knows that. Because he says he's seen on these roles and I know for a fact it was not mind. [SPEAKER_01] I can confirm. [SPEAKER_01] Do we have four werewolves? What's going on? I'm confused by why you're confused. Yeah, like this is all been very important. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah, okay. I mean, there's one person here that I've saw in the role in the middle. Fuck this. I'm gonna, I'll just fucking level with you because this is making me fucking crazy. I know for a fact that you are lying and I know for a fact that you are. So I saw a seer in the middle. No. I'm the seer and I looked at your role. How I know that you're lying and that's how I know that you're lying. Okay, that was the rubber because you took it. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, like this is all been very important. Yeah, okay, I mean there's one person here that [SPEAKER_02] of [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] How I know [SPEAKER_00] Why, and that's how you know. [SPEAKER_01] How do we proceed? Passes. So what have you seen in the middle? I didn't look in the middle. I looked at Mitch's role. I wanted to look at a role. So it's like, and what was he? He was aware of, again, incorrect. [SPEAKER_02] So what did you see in the middle? [SPEAKER_01] Luckily. [SPEAKER_01] I ain't what I started as. I can't say with confidence. [SPEAKER_01] So I'm on the good team. So who were you voting for? I mean, you think you, why do you think I, you're not voting for this? Because we got a Robert Anitrole figure out there. [SPEAKER_02] wrong week e [SPEAKER_02] I think Mike definitely stole from Mitchell. I think that makes sense why he would be lying. Yeah, I think so too. Unless he's been listening. [SPEAKER_01] I think that makes sense why he would be lying. Yeah, I think so too. Unless he was confirming my role. Unless he started as a werewolf as well, which is why I wanted to confirm your role because I wanted to see what you did when I confirmed the real copycat knowing you weren't the copycat. Yeah, yeah. And it is. I think you just kind of missed that. I got it right in your life. I was trying to not make a play. I love it. I was trying to. [SPEAKER_00] Gracias. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] This is the Controller Lens. The\u0643\u0648\u0646er Lens. Okay. Yo, you can do this. You can't do this again. [SPEAKER_02] I am a... I was trying to understand. [SPEAKER_02] No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Just joking. Yeah, what was it, sorry. No, it was. [SPEAKER_02] So here, so I think Mike robbed from you and I switched you to so Mike's Rob has nothing to do with this So like Mike is still a little more old [SPEAKER_01] if we think he did that which I think it's very possible do you think there's a lot of work in our world i don't think so do you think there's more than one more no there isn't do you think it was a loan where wolf and i saw coffee cat here just a moment [SPEAKER_02] I think it's very plausible. Do you think there's more of a way to do it? He can for our white role. I don't think so. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] I was blown where wall fence. [SPEAKER_02] Just a bit like one. [SPEAKER_02] Because that was the copycat was do you remember? I didn't look in the same, I didn't want to. That's right, I was like this sort of whole. So you're actually low wear while photolidating. That's why I'm not that low. [SPEAKER_01] I didn't look in the center. I didn't know what this is. I just saw you see your D-Lone Werewolf at a little. That's why I looked at it. Yeah, lone werewolf looks in the center. I saw a copy cap. That's why I was confident when you said me to go first, but then I was not confident to say the next part. So you think Mike's a werewolf, and I'm a robber and bitches this year, and you were just fucking trolling me currently. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. So we vote for Mike. I'm on board. What if he switched? [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I think so. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] So this is what it all was. [SPEAKER_01] What if him and Michael were wolves? So here's the thing. But if we were seconds left.

[SPEAKER_01] Alright. [SPEAKER_00] which trolling girl? I was one of the roles that's been called which is very suspicious so. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] So that's some sort of spell. That was interesting. Was this fishy other stuff? That's what you have to say. That was totally... [SPEAKER_01] The\u5176ans. This is\u662f\u554a. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Sick. I don't believe ever a second. I don't believe that either. I was the series though. Did you copycat into trope maker? No. [SPEAKER_00] Bye. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Is it just because he's being weird? [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Who's your Ralph from? [SPEAKER_00] I don't know if I said go. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_00] Is it bad? [SPEAKER_00] Or they bad? Was it bad? No, it wasn't not bad. No, okay. I don't show you what's bad. I don't show you what's bad. [SPEAKER_01] It was this unknown. Oh, so I'm a little weird weird. Yeah [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, we're everywhere like this right now. Yeah. We don't believe that one. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, that's a big deal. [SPEAKER_00] Thank you. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, yeah. [SPEAKER_00] So, we just want one. [SPEAKER_02] I swanched. [SPEAKER_02] I think I saw its just some of somebody's trouble [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Problem is it doesn't concern me because I think Mike's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_00] maybe when the heads go down like this. [SPEAKER_01] just because it's so weird to lie about being the troublemaker. It's such a vital role to the villagers. No, no, it's not lie about your troublemaker actions. It's weird to lie about being like the troublemaker. You just say it's my troublemaker. [SPEAKER_00] Just say it's my gold true. Yeah, I know it's weird [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I know but like it's weird because you don't actively try to solve the puzzle You just like the chaos of your action So like and that's also Mike he normally likes to try to solve the puzzle based on the villager team I think right now the problem I think Mike right now Mike's being like he's gonna be like actually I didn't I was [SPEAKER_02] I don't know. [SPEAKER_02] I agree. [SPEAKER_00] Who knows? Says! [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] That was funny, I like Jr. [SPEAKER_02] I was trying to see if someone else would be clicking this here, because I wanted to know if there was a see out there. [SPEAKER_01] That's a weird thing to do because why would you know why would you care if there was a CRVR [SPEAKER_00] I feel like I would totally do that. Like I like doing that too. Like I feel like I would probably only shitting on my strategies when Mike does them. And not. And not. All right. [SPEAKER_01] I was prepared only [SPEAKER_01] I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Alright, so we're running out of time. Who'd you see in the middle? Paul, I did. [SPEAKER_00] I didn't look in the middle which which user I looked at it and he was the rubber so I can confirm he was the rubber So I wanted to see if he could be caught again [SPEAKER_01] I looked at it. [SPEAKER_01] They turned are not subscribed... [SPEAKER_00] So we don't know what could you mic would you switch [SPEAKER_02] Actually, it doesn't matter because I did switch Justin and Paul So will your Rob doesn't change anything. Okay. What we're gonna know because he robbed us [SPEAKER_00] What were you? Because he robbed first. He robbed first. He robbed first. And then I thought, I'm not going to leave that to me. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, he runs first and then I said, I'm gonna leave that to me. That's my little secret. That's scary. Okay, that's my little secret. I know what you are. My life is going on. [SPEAKER_02] This for a \u0441\u043c\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442\u044c character pizza pizza? [SPEAKER_00] I'm gonna get this by little secret. I know what you are. [SPEAKER_00] I'm going to close the letter again to ship Thrash. [SPEAKER_00] No. [SPEAKER_00] You're saying you switched me in Justin? Yes. You're the... You think he's world for Dan? You looked at something bad probably. I'm not gonna tell you because I'm gonna... [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] HAITMARK [SPEAKER_01] I'm not gonna tell you because I'm gonna use my hair to figure out what you are. [SPEAKER_02] He had to figure out what you are. If this is what is actually happening right here, then yes, make sure something bad now. [SPEAKER_00] Right here [SPEAKER_00] You switch these two, sorry? No, you switch me. Yeah, but he robbed first. He robbed from Justin, okay. First. [SPEAKER_02] No, he's just me. Yeah, but he robbed first. [SPEAKER_02] first. So the bad card went there and then I switched the robber so you have the robber he is a seer and he is the copycat which is one of these bad rolls. [SPEAKER_00] Do you promise you to switch me mate? I promise you. It wasn't the same mate. [SPEAKER_02] I promise you. [SPEAKER_00] What were you? [SPEAKER_00] 30 seconds left. I think we gotta vote for Mitch or Justin. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_00] and to see the car crash, same work, [SPEAKER_01] So what are you? 20 seconds. What were you? I don't know who fucked about for. [SPEAKER_02] What are you? 20 seconds. What were you? [SPEAKER_01] What were you? I'm going to be wanting for you. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] video. . [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I voted for Mitchell otherwise. Mitchell and I were where we'll sit down. [SPEAKER_00] So that means just an individual or werewolves and I'm like maybe a Tanner copycat or Mike's a Tanner and Justin's. This is a... He's telling the truth. I store for you, Mark. He's on. Everyone. [SPEAKER_01] This is... He's telling the truth. I store for you, Uncle. He's telling me what's up."}

Get me. [SPEAKER_02] Get at me, ready to vote? Both of me. [SPEAKER_02] I think you deserve it. Oh man, really? That'd be nice. Yeah, I mean, like, totally. Like, I copy this strategy and apply it next time you are the Tanner. [SPEAKER_01] I think you deserve it. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I mean like... [SPEAKER_01] I mean, I probably will never have around where I don't switch again. Yeah, this is weird. I think just... [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, this is weird. I think it just isn't switched. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, this makes me nervous. Yeah, both of us are on the hook here. All strategies that you're doing, no, I'm tired. Are you gonna tell us at the 11th hour? [SPEAKER_00] Yeah both of us are on the [SPEAKER_01] I'm not gonna put all the strategies that you're doing. No, I'm not. [SPEAKER_01] I literally never cuz if you [SPEAKER_02] Because if you are, like I want you to enjoy that. No, I- [SPEAKER_01] No, I picked up your card, put it back down, and then went like this. This is just so sad. It just seems strange. You fall. Like this is 100% of the truth. If you saw what you saw, I did. I'm not fully inclined. [SPEAKER_02] I did. I'm like, I've been fully inclined to believe Justin and I deserve this death and loss. Good. [SPEAKER_02] I went out in a limb to try to tell the truth, thinking that I got trouble me and it was no- [SPEAKER_01] You were gonna be the one I was gonna switch you and Mike [SPEAKER_02] but I didn't. So I'm gonna vote for making case you did. [SPEAKER_01] I like that. Yeah. I respect that. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] since he was the intended recipient. [SPEAKER_01] I don't believe the agents switch. I didn't switch. [SPEAKER_02] Mike [SPEAKER_01] \u062d\u0642\u0631\u0626\u06cc Niagara [SPEAKER_00] I know! [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I know I'm the one of us I did not interact with you at all if I I could kill you if I did make the switch It would have been the same but I did not I was I picked up I like where this is I picked it up And I said you know what I'll switch over the mics, but [SPEAKER_02] One of us shit!! [SPEAKER_00] Like I said, now that anywhere in our world we live, we [SPEAKER_00] Bye. [SPEAKER_02] Right, because you can from John Marlin. So I weirdly trust him. And then you untie. I trust in John. Confirm my role. Weirdly. [SPEAKER_01] and then YUM Kivolowitz woman you go, my roll! [SPEAKER_02] Because you used... Well, you've always had the one you saw in the middle. It was the copycat. I was just going to see if it would came up with it. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] What was the other one you saw in the middle? [SPEAKER_01] That's what we have. Or potentially this. Like let's [SPEAKER_02] So you make a good point, like we should vote for Mike. [SPEAKER_01] I don't think we should vote for Mike. We're not. Because I did not switch you. [SPEAKER_02] I'm ready to go. Oh, but he's not saying he didn't switch it. [SPEAKER_01] Oh, but he's not saying he didn't switch anymore. Well, I mean, I told him to switch him, and I didn't switch him, which means I did not switch him. You switched me. I think Mike actually might be a Tanner. And that's why he's upset that we're not going to kill him now. No. That's my guess. I'm very confused that you didn't switch. I did it. [SPEAKER_02] This is me! [SPEAKER_02] I'm leaving point, I'm gonna go from Mitchell just in case. That's my answer to- [SPEAKER_01] That's fine, I'm still voting for you because if you're the TANI, you know, of course, I mean, because I, I picture card up like both are Mitchell. [SPEAKER_02] Of course, one for me. [SPEAKER_02] He told me to vote for Mitchell. [SPEAKER_02] I can't, like, you can spear it. I'm ready to go. Why would I vote for Mitchell? No, you don't. You vote for Paul. I vote if Paul doesn't matter what, because I can't vote for him. No, listen, you have a really good point that Justin would definitely switch. [SPEAKER_00] I'm ready to go. Why would I vote? [SPEAKER_01] No, you don't have a poll. Justin. I'm voting for Paul, no matter what, because I can't vote for him. [SPEAKER_01] Yes, so I'm still voting for you even if he's switched. [SPEAKER_02] No, he switched me with somebody. Yes, I understand. So I'm not the where it will fit anymore. Yeah, but he switched me and Mitchell. You're a good guy. I don't think he did. You're a good guy. [SPEAKER_01] Yes, I understand. So I'm not the wearable for anymore. [SPEAKER_01] Don't they he did [SPEAKER_02] You're fucking tan or somehow, even though I saw trouble maker. Cause you fucked up this whole round. [SPEAKER_02] I like it. One new nickname. I have not liked this game. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] This is insane, Mike. I think we got a vote for Mitch, because I think if you believe... I'm voting for you. I'm voting for you. I'm on the dress inside. I'm voting for you. If you believe that Justin had to have switched because he is in K-pop... Yes, and if he did switch, she switched us to. He still wants the vote for you. And I would still want the vote for you. No, I think he switched me and Mitchell. I didn't. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] If you will, I'm going for you. I'm going for you. Have a good rest. [SPEAKER_00] And you are on your first word kingdom. [SPEAKER_01] for you. [SPEAKER_01] Yes, and if he did switch, she switched us to. He still wants to vote for you. And I would still want to vote for you. [SPEAKER_01] I didn't. I did not touch Mitchell's card. I picked up your card. Justin would lie like this. I would. [SPEAKER_02] I picked up your card. Justin Wood likes this. I would have known who only the very best he has left. No, who the werewolf, sorry, who the werewolf. Yeah, but that doesn't make any sense. The werewolf would know that they are the werewolf. Yeah, but then Justin wouldn't have anybody on his team voting with him. Justin Wood have nobody in his team voting with him. No, because he'd have all the villagers voting for me. [SPEAKER_00] It is. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, without just making it real. [SPEAKER_01] to [SPEAKER_00] anybody on his team. [SPEAKER_01] Therefore, the [SPEAKER_01] Which is good, because you're aware of it. That's what he wants. That's the thing still. Unless he's about to reveal it last second. I'm not. Let's just let it die down. Yeah, let's just sit and quiet for the last five minutes, seconds and just enjoy it. Yes, kill the l- [SPEAKER_02] THANKS FOR WATCHING!

[SPEAKER_03] I didn't switch you just in. [SPEAKER_01] Fuck James. [SPEAKER_01] I have a good chance. I have a 66% chance of being switched by James. [SPEAKER_01] Why? Because they have to switch to others? [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] So almost they're good to use you. Why is that process like? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, because it's just math. [SPEAKER_01] One eye, four, four. [SPEAKER_03] It's just the math. Let me think. You won't make me think I'd take you. I'm not the math. You're a math. The math makes me think.

What's that over there? It maybe does. [SPEAKER_02] What's that loader? It maybe does it then trouble maker. Oh, oh tell us [SPEAKER_03] I didn't make somebody aware of it. Well, if I made somebody the apprentice here. Okay. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, vote left. [SPEAKER_01] I would rather you all vote for me. [SPEAKER_00] Let's vote left. It doesn't fucking matter who switched to and who wrote what it is [SPEAKER_02] What if he's reverse fucking psychology in us right now? And he's at Werewolf? Yeah. Just straight up, that's what he's doing. [SPEAKER_01] He's aware. [SPEAKER_00] Hmm. [SPEAKER_01] just straight up. [SPEAKER_01] Well, he's got a 55% chance of being either. That's math, that's math. Well, actually technically right now, I have a 66% chance of being an aware wolf. Okay, don't know math. No, it's 50-50. But I have a Tanner. I'm okay with only left if that's the case. If we're all good on this people. [SPEAKER_01] I feel like Paul might have turned himself into a werewolf though. [SPEAKER_03] I didn't. I switched Mitchell into the apprentice here. [SPEAKER_01] and you're up for me. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] qualities less [SPEAKER_01] Billy was supposed to look at my card to confirm he's sorry. [SPEAKER_02] Pauho, you voted for. I'm curious. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Fuck me, won't you play? [SPEAKER_03] It probably left. [SPEAKER_01] Probably James I guess? Great, I hate you. I'll vote Paul. You vote James. [SPEAKER_01] Let's just know what the middle said, Vogue James is supposed to vote left. [SPEAKER_03] Like I'm always like winning or like we lose but we kill James [SPEAKER_02] I just feel like some fish is going on here. Did you, who did you swing? [SPEAKER_01] I think Paul turned himself into a world better. That's what I think happened. 100. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] I think he also did turn himself into a world. [SPEAKER_01] But I vote you vote for me. [SPEAKER_01] James, who do you switch? Does it matter? No. I don't care unless you switch to me. In which case, you should not... [SPEAKER_02] kill that other person. James. [SPEAKER_02] I trust you to the end of the Earth. Yeah. I think he switched himself into a werewolf. OK. If that's the case, did you put that werewolf? How? [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_00] I would switch himself into a wearer as the witch. [SPEAKER_00] You switched yourself into a one that was the same, I did it. [SPEAKER_01] That's the other thing I did it. Which is himself as well. How would you make yourself more or less? Because you could potentially win. Because you could believe them when he said he turned someone into the predecessor. [SPEAKER_03] Yep. Let's not focus on the Y or the hypothetical. What did you do? If he did that... [SPEAKER_01] What's that? [SPEAKER_00] One in the world, remaining. I don't know. [SPEAKER_02] One in the world. [SPEAKER_04] One in the world to the main. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_03] Sick.

What do you think so? Because I think you've wished yourself into a world. [SPEAKER_04] Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_03] So we killed Justin?

[SPEAKER_01] I don't think they are. I think they're both wear wolves. I think our band is pretty safe to go with either of them. [SPEAKER_01] But the thing is they're gonna kill one of us. [SPEAKER_00] You want to kill? [SPEAKER_00] That's good Mitchell. Okay, so it's gonna be a pretty one kill. I'll get it that I know let's get it. Okay sounds good.

[SPEAKER_01] No easy answers. [SPEAKER_01] I think the best player count for this game is three. Yeah, 100%. Yeah. [SPEAKER_03] It gets really strategic. Oh yeah, we didn't even think about it and we're like three. It's gonna be awful. I thought it was gonna be so good. And then we played it at three and it was like the best games of this ever played. [SPEAKER_04] It gets really strategic [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I thought it was going to be so... [SPEAKER_04] the [SPEAKER_04] It's like a test puzzle playing with 3p [SPEAKER_01] three people it's so cool [SPEAKER_04] Well, I guess there's a lot of unknowns in the center when you click three, right? There still look three unknowns, right? So you still have... [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, they're still like free unknowns right so you still have [SPEAKER_04] Well, I'm happy that even though you had the option to play three, you invited me to come. Yeah. Do I have energy lotion? It's got caffeine in it. The girl's. No ex. I had it in my chocolate. I had it in my beverage, and I had it in my washing, you know.

[SPEAKER_01] But you ended up with a card that I started with. [SPEAKER_02] the rubber. So that makes where's our rubber? I think there are two hoots together. So now I'm the rubber, you're in the insomniac and you've cleaned that so you don't want to be killing up a tanner it might be the wearer wall. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] I think there are two hoods together. [SPEAKER_01] What's your take on this? [SPEAKER_02] take all this beer here. I can confirm one of those. Sear comes before everybody else. Yeah, yeah. So she elected Rachel's robber. Yeah. Robert says he is that. So you can confirm me I can confirm her. So why would he lie if he wasn't the werewolf? [SPEAKER_01] I can confirm her. [SPEAKER_01] You could be a better. [SPEAKER_01] It could be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] I mean if I'm the Tanner, then... [SPEAKER_01] de la tette Louise YE editor. [SPEAKER_02] Why would you lie if he weren't the way I was? I don't know if I'm following that. [SPEAKER_02] The town [SPEAKER_01] I don't know, I'm trying to figure out why bitches. Slime. [SPEAKER_02] Get out of here, Mike. The Tanner is worth lying to try to make himself. [SPEAKER_01] Mike, come up with a good explanation of what's happening with that. I'm thinking of it. [SPEAKER_00] What's happening? [SPEAKER_02] I'm taking it over here. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] Just dripping with sweat. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, okay. [SPEAKER_01] Alright, nice shad. Holy smokes. 3 million? 3 million? [SPEAKER_02] 3,000,000. Wow! Nice! [SPEAKER_02] So are we assuming that Mike is the Tanner then because he's climbing beowarwolves? I mean either either he's the Tanner and We kill him thinking he's the werewolf and he wins or we can [SPEAKER_01] Erik Ruin [SPEAKER_02] vote left and trying to play our strategy but we both sides of it. [SPEAKER_02] But there's nowhere else for him to go. I understand that strategic move. [SPEAKER_01] If he was a werewolf, he would have been able to look at something in the middle. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] But he kind of looked at another whereup. [SPEAKER_01] He could have left another werewolf. Yeah, he could have, which would leave him. Who, what was the order of people revealing their cart? He went first, didn't he? Yeah. He was the very first person to claim to be an insomniac. Yeah. That was weird. Would a tanner do that? Yes. Where a werewolf do that? No. Usually werewolves kind of chill out for a bit. That's true. And then wait to see what's available. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] That's true. And it wakes you up with everything else. Especially with the seersaw. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] said do we vote make it do we vote to the left [SPEAKER_01] I'm not making any noise. I'm going to go to the left. [SPEAKER_01] problem in your logic. We need to go left. [SPEAKER_02] So if we all vote to the left, it's a draw. Nobody does. But I can fuck that up. [SPEAKER_01] I can fuck that up. [SPEAKER_02] That's true. [SPEAKER_01] But if he if you're yeah he could [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I could. I can't vote for himself. I can't vote for himself. I can't vote for myself. So if he's aware of what he can fuck it up, if he's the Tanner, I can still fuck it up for my turn. [SPEAKER_02] But it's just not gonna do anything. [SPEAKER_01] But it's just like it's just like I just lose and I just make something we all we all [SPEAKER_02] All right let's have a look at this. Eh yeah and then we all- [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] So if I'm the Tanner, everyone votes for the left and I just vote for a random person. Villager still wins. Oh, okay. Yeah. So there's... [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] If I'm the wear-off and we all vote to the left. You would, then I wouldn't. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] You and I would yes. [SPEAKER_01] So what did we think he was? He was, we think he was a Tanner because he spoke so quickly. Yes. I think that makes it good. [SPEAKER_02] Yes, I think that makes good sense. I think he's a champion. [SPEAKER_02] Look at William third-tourney injective. [SPEAKER_01] We at the Those Are Jeff, we train endings. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] That makes logical sense strategically without knowing his character at all. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Bye. [SPEAKER_02] I think it's 50-50 draw. And so far those have not been kindly to bench, so let's not let them go. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. We're actually photo when you think and we'll do the opposite. Well! [SPEAKER_00] s [SPEAKER_01] No, you know, cause that doesn't work for Body Goal. [SPEAKER_02] I'm gonna vote to the left so I'm gonna vote for the... I just... [SPEAKER_01] I just think you guys are cahoots in your both werewolves [SPEAKER_00] Only 36 left. [SPEAKER_01] Why? [SPEAKER_02] Why would you help? [SPEAKER_01] I don't know, you guys just give me this vibe that you guys are both werewolves. [SPEAKER_02] You have my card, you know what I want. [SPEAKER_01] I know you're good. I feel like no one's confirmed her story. Hello, Joe Smith. [SPEAKER_02] So that's when 18 seconds, I can't confirm my story. [SPEAKER_01] Nobody can confirm my story. She kind of confirmed yours. She confirmed yours. Yeah, I've known it's confirmed hers. I mean, yeah, but not many people can confirm this year. [SPEAKER_02] I think because we stressed out so much that would be an explanation. I think we both, we've got one second. One left. Oh, left. [SPEAKER_00] "}

[SPEAKER_01] supposedly [SPEAKER_02] Sounds good. [SPEAKER_01] Right now, so this is possible. This is possible, but I feel like insomnia is the easiest way around it. That's true. Right? [SPEAKER_03] That's true. Right? And Tamiya gives these these just way around it. Because even if she was actually... No, it was not for her. But even if she was actually the inside of me, actually, you can wake up and something else will still say she's the inside of me. [SPEAKER_02] I would know if I swapped her or not. That's true. So did you claim that you are the inside of a vehicle? I woke up as the inside of me. [SPEAKER_03] So then he switched us to. [SPEAKER_03] if he switched. [SPEAKER_02] I switched someone, yeah. 100%? Yeah, I switched someone. [SPEAKER_01] Even if he did such a sudden he can't switch from the inside and we'll claim he all the inside So he has such a thought Yes, exactly And let she's lying [SPEAKER_03] So he has to do that. Yes, exactly. And she's lying. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, she's a wild card. [SPEAKER_02] Sensei Sensei sensual hey guys, I'm over by the ramp [SPEAKER_03] Oh! [SPEAKER_03] Who's sent that? Oh, it's...

I know I play that game for co-op because you can play and you can teach them in the beginning and then hopefully they just don't become the trainer and have to do all by themselves. [SPEAKER_01] Oh, that was crazy. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, they yield stuff. They're selling a waiver and everything. [SPEAKER_01] How did it get in? The door, at the door, was locked. [SPEAKER_03] You know, the middle door there is unlocked and number eight down that hallway is supposed to be unlocked all night. [SPEAKER_01] Oh for us. For. Okay. [SPEAKER_03] Okay, that's the essence. And really, you can go through the Fannistland Hotel. It's always a lot. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] There you go. [SPEAKER_01] Unfortunately, I think even with the bonus pause time, I still have no idea what's going on. [SPEAKER_03] There was no discussion happening right now. [SPEAKER_01] Oh no, I know, I'm just... even in my own head. [SPEAKER_02] If anything, I'm forgetting what was happening. Yeah, that's true. I'm like going back, I'm losing info every second.

[SPEAKER_02] I look scared you fuck. What makes me trust her is that she came out and was very confident that she was herself. Even after I said there's a trove maker. [SPEAKER_03] I look truster. What makes you a truster? [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] So [SPEAKER_01] the trove maker. If you're trying to stay alive and there's no information out, it's all necessary to easily weigh out. Yeah. Because it's just no one can confirm it. Especially you. And if she wants to be, if she were, if she wants to stay alive, no one's going to kill someone they're ever sure to think about. It's true. [SPEAKER_03] It's true. [SPEAKER_02] So there's a 50-50 chance that I'm aware of or I'm a Tanner or Insomniac. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, but you're not, we're not on your case. No, you're not. You're not teaching us, Daryl. [SPEAKER_01] I'm not sure if I'm sorry. I think we're good. I'm gonna vote the way you are. I think we're... [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_02] and forget this... [SPEAKER_02] I think we're good too. Okay. And if there's a wear-off here, I'm impressed. I'm really impressed. It's just good. Okay. So we're all voting to the left. Yeah.

[SPEAKER_00] Oh, copycat. Close your eyes. Everyone. Wake up and still there. Now I'm still there for you, your mom. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, how do we turn that off? [SPEAKER_01] Chat someone figure that out. Everyone. [SPEAKER_00] We're slowly going to lose your eyes. Where will lose? Wake up and look for other where you have one. If there is a like one where will. And if they look at a card from the center. [SPEAKER_01] You're in, pr\u00e9sentation [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] the same. But we play with that on the other ones and there's none of those things. [SPEAKER_00] Where will you close your eyes? See here, wake up. You may look at another player's card or two of the center cards. [SPEAKER_01] or two of us in the past. So much that we play without description and just hit seer wake up. [SPEAKER_00] Closure eyes.

[SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] Give me ever had like a tiny muscle size which just feels like that. No. [SPEAKER_02] I had one the first night and it was like somebody like that. I was like, scared. Oh, that's weird. Amy's not stalling. Chop. [SPEAKER_01] Trouble maker! [SPEAKER_02] Interesting. We want to say who he moved. [SPEAKER_01] Not yet, okay. Because you guys have not said anything, so... [SPEAKER_02] Well, I'm gonna say I saw things. That was a seer. [SPEAKER_01] How's this here? [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] My rules been claimed. Okay. [SPEAKER_01] Do you want to say who, which one it is? Yes. [SPEAKER_02] Yes, it was a trouble maker. [SPEAKER_01] Alright, we know for FactPulse line. [SPEAKER_02] And Mitchell hasn't said any truths or lies yet. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I haven't figured out what I'm gonna do yet. [SPEAKER_02] I know I well I know why he's having trouble figuring out because I looked at his card [SPEAKER_01] I know. [SPEAKER_01] Oh, what is he? [SPEAKER_02] He's worth that is not true. [SPEAKER_01] You were one of the people I switched. That was true. [SPEAKER_02] So really did you switch in with me or Paul or yourself? [SPEAKER_01] I can't see man. I can't see. [SPEAKER_02] I can't, sir. Well then did he switch with himself and you just want to say he's a werewolf? [SPEAKER_01] No, I can't switch, I'm trying to switch themself, it's only the Robert. [SPEAKER_02] Oh no, sorry, it must have been another one of the witch. The witch, yes. [SPEAKER_01] the witch. Yes. [SPEAKER_01] um... Paul, what are you actually? [SPEAKER_02] Okay. [SPEAKER_02] It's really fucking useless, but I don't want to know what it is, it's funny. [SPEAKER_01] Copycat into drunk. Yeah. Could you grab drunk? [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Chicky boy, I think you're a robber. I think you're a robber and you rob from Mitchell. I think you're a robber and we rob from Mitchell. Which is really funny because I switched you guys. [SPEAKER_02] You're a robber. I think you're a robber. [SPEAKER_02] it sure which is highly fun make a dress [SPEAKER_02] Well, I started actually the werewolf at the beginning of the round he was. [SPEAKER_02] I honestly just like, copycat into the drum, because I was like, then I know I'm good. So I guess I'm aware of now. I guess so for me. [SPEAKER_01] I was like, didn't I know I'm good? [SPEAKER_02] You switch us. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] I don't forget what else to do then. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] \u7d50 hold on [SPEAKER_02] Could they boast me where wolves? Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Let's play that out. If they're both werewolves, then Justin didn't switch anybody. I'm still good. You said both who? Who's the both of you, Tygo? You and Justin. The boys. The boys. [SPEAKER_01] The boys. [SPEAKER_02] So bear boys. You and me are good. I think you probably are believable. And I saw the guy says, I said Mitchell's werewolf. [SPEAKER_00] So where boys? You and me? [SPEAKER_01] That night... [SPEAKER_01] Have we confirmed his role yet? No. No, he's coming out to swing though I believe it's confidence. [SPEAKER_02] Nice comes [SPEAKER_02] I'm gonna put this in too. [SPEAKER_02] Could we only- [SPEAKER_01] We only have like one role that confirms. [SPEAKER_01] Because like who can confirm the seer? Who seers the seer? Copycat can see the seer, but then like if you're claiming seer when the seer's alive. [SPEAKER_02] Are you gonna meet or are you like not? [SPEAKER_02] I don't think you're the troublemaker. I think you're trying to like, I think he's been aware of me into, I'm aware of it now, but I'm not. I don't think I am. So even if I am, like I have to play, like I like that. So we vote for Mitchell. [SPEAKER_01] Freundin [SPEAKER_01] Transone with N\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 [SPEAKER_01] So [SPEAKER_02] Because Justin's on the fence for me. [SPEAKER_01] Sure, we can vote for Mitchell. Uh, so wait, what? Uh-huh, what was it me? I thought I got swapped. [SPEAKER_02] No, we're going, if he's lying about being a troublemaker, you actually didn't get swapped. I think if we go that route, I think we have to vote for Justin. [SPEAKER_00] I think it's either he's lying. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] If you think it's wearable, if we go... [SPEAKER_01] Now it's Killmitch. I'm going to- I'm going to board to Killmitch. [SPEAKER_02] I'm voting Justin. He was on board pretty quick. [SPEAKER_01] That's because I actually didn't switch anybody. I went like this. [SPEAKER_01] when I woke up. This is shady. I think I'm going to go for a job. [SPEAKER_02] This is Shady. I think we have to vote for Justin. I think we have to vote for Justin. They're going to. [SPEAKER_01] You're gonna give Mitchell the win. I promise you don't vote Justin because he's actually one minute [SPEAKER_02] Don't- [SPEAKER_00] remaining. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] But I admit that it's the lone werewolf. I think they're both. I would really, really think they're both. [SPEAKER_01] I'm gonna lose this game because Paul can't make up his life. What if he's a Tanner? [SPEAKER_02] He's a Tanner. I think Justin robbed from me. [SPEAKER_00] I'm voting Justin for what? [SPEAKER_02] Justin for what what is the Tanner though? He is it he rock for me. I don't know that makes it so much sense [SPEAKER_01] I don't know how big that's so much sense. And this is why we've been giggling because we both know that he rosy is a Tanner Plane. Chat, they suck. I'm 100% he rocked and that was... [SPEAKER_00] only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_02] Are we ready? [SPEAKER_01] Derek Kilmential, he just said he is the werewolf. [SPEAKER_02] I was the werewolf. Paul, ready? [SPEAKER_02] No. [SPEAKER_01] I got robbed. [SPEAKER_01] Don't let us get robbed again. But you're following the junkies time. [SPEAKER_02] Do you think he's Tanner? I think he either did Rob Mitchell or he's Tanner. Yeah, I think. [SPEAKER_01] No I'm the trauma maker and I switch anybody. Which one? Do we vote Justin? Or do we vote me? We vote Mitchell. We vote Justin. [SPEAKER_00] Time is up, everyone. Three. [SPEAKER_01] Bye."}

[SPEAKER_00] What did you run? [SPEAKER_02] uh... he was the drunk [SPEAKER_02] This is good polish. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Okay, I've actually feel really good for the first time ever about being this role. I was a drunk and those two are making me feel happy about that because I think there's some bad shit over there. I don't know what they are, but it's making me think I'm good. I think I'm on your team. But you switched me. Oh, but there were four. There were four. You dropped four. Oh yes. That's good. [SPEAKER_02] That's good. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] That is really sick. [SPEAKER_02] Right, so it's a switch and then the drum. Right? Yeah, it's a tap. [SPEAKER_01] I think it's a tenor or a wolf. I'm sure this could be a wolf. I have no information but that's the point. But you have any... [SPEAKER_03] But that's it. [SPEAKER_02] Bye. [SPEAKER_02] You started as drunk, right? You didn't start as copycat? So I got Mitchell's card and then Mitchell got rid of my card. Who did you rob? [SPEAKER_01] Copycat. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] You didn't rock. I didn't, I didn't rock. No. Okay. [SPEAKER_02] No, Susanne, I'm just trying to focus on it. So your card is in the middle. So my card is in the middle, is it? It was a werewolf. Okay, so we vote how hard it is switching, buddy. [SPEAKER_00] so my card is in the middle of it. [SPEAKER_02] Ahhhhh! Sorry. [SPEAKER_02] Just in this channel I think. [SPEAKER_01] I believe you, if you duked me, good for you. Let's go. [SPEAKER_00] I copycatted into a werewolf. [SPEAKER_00] and I join Tyler at night. You might be aware of this. If you point to the card, I'll tell you what to do. He's in the air. [SPEAKER_01] Ha! [SPEAKER_01] \u597d\u597d\u4f60\u767c From the salmon [SPEAKER_02] I hate you. But then really, what if there's also a banner at this stage? [SPEAKER_00] It's only a 30% chance so it's really slim and I do think voting for Tyler's the right thing to do or me in that regard is gaining your trust [SPEAKER_02] But then what if one of us is a Tanner? There could be a Tanner over here. It's not you though. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] be sure. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] I thought I know which one you use change with, that's all. [SPEAKER_00] I'm going to enjoy what I want to point. I won't react. I won't react. [SPEAKER_01] Here I want to... [SPEAKER_01] I will react. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] I'm gonna see you like the middle card. [SPEAKER_00] I'm happy with however you vote. [SPEAKER_02] Oh, no. So, no. [SPEAKER_02] I think that makes your head still.

I really think Tyler was the werewolf. So... [SPEAKER_02] even if they're both. [SPEAKER_02] Justin's the right boot. So really if you did switch, that means Justin's the only werewolf left. [SPEAKER_01] So you [SPEAKER_00] I'm [SPEAKER_00] 000 [SPEAKER_02] Did you wake up alone? You have to tell us. I woke up with Justin. Okay, yeah. [SPEAKER_02] So Justin's a werewolf and if you did switch me my role's gone and I'm good now. No, no, because he's... [SPEAKER_01] No, because he used your eye switch to wearables. Oh, you switched. [SPEAKER_02] Oh you switched us, I thought you switched. No. I switched to rebels. So... [SPEAKER_01] leave a [SPEAKER_03] one minute remaining. [SPEAKER_01] Remaking all but you fucking no I'm telling you yeah, yeah, I think it's just a figure yeah I'm with you especially if there's two werewolves then I can't be a horrible. I mean I may be a Tanner but if I'm not gonna [SPEAKER_03] I mean you Northwest [SPEAKER_00] I'm not gonna- No, I- because I copy-catted into a werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I might be a worb- but I would just not. Yeah, you're best to play like you're not. [SPEAKER_02] Who, which one? He picked... it doesn't matter anymore. Justin, because he was trying to... Yeah, he was trying to tie me up. [SPEAKER_01] Justin because he was trying to see me. Yeah, he was trying to tie me up. We should kill Paul.

[SPEAKER_00] I know I did. [SPEAKER_02] His own story involves him being two roles. Yeah. He just claimed two roles. [SPEAKER_02] I'm being easy. Oh, that's another level. Oh, he's old. [SPEAKER_01] The story requires in being too wrong. [SPEAKER_00] Oh my god. [SPEAKER_02] I'm just going to twist. Absolutely. It's just broke just his brain. Oh, is it just beer?

This is a... A dark round I can tell you that. Haha. Mitchell. [SPEAKER_01] This is a... [SPEAKER_01] Mitchell, yes. [SPEAKER_01] One thing I can tell you is Justin is lying. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] I believe that. [SPEAKER_01] Because I saw a copycat in this location, and I saw werewolf in that location. [SPEAKER_02] Okay. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, that's making me feel a lot better. I was... [SPEAKER_02] I was lying. I was the Robert from the beginning. This is a no lie round. I took a little time off though. No lie round. I was a drunk Bam [SPEAKER_01] Applause [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] convenient. It's very, that's why. [SPEAKER_02] Literally tasting... [SPEAKER_02] saying it now.

[SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] So therefore Tyler [SPEAKER_01] therefore Tyler so it's either the trouble maker the can I propose an alternative [SPEAKER_02] Can I propose an alternative? I'm gonna vote for whoever you want me to vote. I am your... Can I propose a counter thing that I think is happening here? That Paul and I both know is true. One of us is one of these roles. [SPEAKER_01] and your- Can I rules accounturthing that I- [SPEAKER_02] So you could still be the Tanner. New. [SPEAKER_02] I think that's exactly what happened to your poll. [SPEAKER_02] One of us robbed from the other person. [SPEAKER_00] I think we'll go just then. [SPEAKER_00] I think Justin's bad. [SPEAKER_00] Because what he's trying to, he thinks I'm something that I'm not. I think you're... And so he's trying to make me think that I'm a bad role now. Which I'm not. You're good? Yeah. I don't know if it's in good. [SPEAKER_02] I think you're... [SPEAKER_02] Trust me. Oh, what are it? It's definitely seen that way. [SPEAKER_01] Totally about it. Totally about it. [SPEAKER_01] What's your role then if you're good? It doesn't matter. [SPEAKER_00] matter. [SPEAKER_01] I know hold on let me know if I should tell you like if you were the troublemaker one minute You've switched cards which matters if you were the robber you could have robbed somebody which matters [SPEAKER_00] \u7d27\u6446\u5ec1\u58f9\u59b3 [SPEAKER_03] You've been switching. [SPEAKER_02] No, no, no, no. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] Justin didn't rob a bad person because there's no bad rule out there except him. [SPEAKER_00] you [SPEAKER_00] Might be Which which two did you see that and that okay? Okay, I was the troublemaker from the beginning my two role claim [SPEAKER_03] only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_00] I wanted information. So who are you thinking we vote for? [SPEAKER_01] This I I hate this round. I wouldn't believe him [SPEAKER_01] I believe [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_00] I believe him. [SPEAKER_02] and I'm both a whoever you are. So, what do you... [SPEAKER_00] Whoever you are. So what do you switch then? I switched you two. Go. Dead serious. [SPEAKER_00] and just as the only one who's being shady in my book so I think people for him I think like the only other thing you could think I was is a Tanner so don't vote for me vote for Justin who am I going to vote for? okay [SPEAKER_03] Time is up, everyone.

I was a villager bro. No, you were not. I'm a villager. I'm a villager. I think you're a YouTuber both wearables. Wait, no. Why don't you switch Dan over you? I was the seer.

[SPEAKER_02] That's what I don't get your play because if you were, Wolf that means he's a wolf now. But then if... [SPEAKER_01] Right, it was a were, well he would be a real man. Well that means he's not a were, that means he's not a were billed, I'm not a villager, that means. [SPEAKER_02] That means he's not a war. That means he's not our bill, George. [SPEAKER_02] He's not aware. And Ed's not aware. Why would he cry? Because my car was a villager. Unless someone swam my car. That's you. But I said 100%. [SPEAKER_01] Why would he cook? [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_03] Unless... [SPEAKER_01] I don't know what SWATMA says you. But I said 100% He said it. He said it. He said it. He said it. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, so end dance which you were the seeers that me here this year. So you [SPEAKER_01] I was a year this year. So you could be aware if you have his car. Unless he was lying. Yes, he was lying about being a poster. But he's saying he saw my daughter. I'm going to the picture. So I don't know why I'm in trust. Because I trust and implicitly. Thank you. I've got a number of reputation fans. Relax. [SPEAKER_00] But he was lying about being a ghost for real. [SPEAKER_02] But he's saying he saw my daughter. I don't know why I didn't trust him. [SPEAKER_02] Thank you. I've got a number of reputation fans are laughing at you. They're getting playing. [SPEAKER_03] Never necessarily a fil- [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I'm a villager. They know I'm a villager. I think the audience knows from all the videos I've been hearing. We have very trustworthy. We have four. [SPEAKER_02] I think we have very trustworthy. We have four people playing. We have to do a minute and a half left. [SPEAKER_01] We got four claims for Villager. So who's the robber? Did we not have that? I guess that's why I asked you minutes ago. So who are you guys? Why are you guys? I'm a soldier. [SPEAKER_02] So who's the Robert? Do we not have... [SPEAKER_02] So what were you guys? Why are you guys? I have a small baby. [SPEAKER_00] I don't believe you for a second. [SPEAKER_01] You're too excited to be a new real world. You're too animated to be a world. I'm feeling I'm being... [SPEAKER_00] What the hell is that? [SPEAKER_02] I really gotta be more upset if I really was a real super young [SPEAKER_01] He's pretty upset. He's pretty upset. Wait, you said, I did by really what? So you're not actually a villager. What are you? I'm a villager. Are you twisted? All right. So Dan is 100% gonna wear wool. Dan is not true. Dan is 100%. Because if he was a wearable, but I switch, then he could be like, all right, it's the worst. [SPEAKER_02] You're twisted okay so damn [SPEAKER_02] That's true! Because if he was a world that I switched, then he could be like, alright, it's the world. But he's waiting for you to say, oh I didn't really switch you guys. I didn't really switch you guys. Well now I'll switch you guys. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_01] I like I like it. I just switch you guys We're not that I'm bad. I'm bad. I see it. Wait, you didn't. Wait, you're lying? Where are you the trouble? Why are you lying? I was the trouble. You're the trouble. But you didn't switch. You were only supposed to come trouble last night. Wait, don't do that. I switched them. You're not one of mine trouble. What a first time. Yeah, that's daytime. I'm so confused. Okay, switch to us. Okay, bomb squad. I can't even find a bomb squad. We don't allow bomb squad in this game. [SPEAKER_00] Wait, you didn't. Wait, you're flying? [SPEAKER_00] I was such a... You're spuzzing trouble! [SPEAKER_03] You were only supposed to come to trouble last night. [SPEAKER_02] You're right, what a first time. [SPEAKER_00] One, two, three. [SPEAKER_00] Oh he switched us. But, okay, Bonsi. Bonsi squad. [SPEAKER_02] I've been going to bomb squad. We don't allow bomb squad in this game. Woohoo! What did Dylan just say? Bomb squad? What does that mean? It'll all be explained on today's All About Dylan. [SPEAKER_02] Welcome to All About Dylan. The only show that's 100% All About Dylan. Now today's episode is brought to you by Viabo.com. Need a boat, then go to Viabo.com. [SPEAKER_01] is better than ViPoke.com. [SPEAKER_02] Now Dylan said the word bomb squad. What does bomb squad mean exactly? Well, I'm about to explain it to you. Basically, in our household, sometimes we say stuff a little ironically or sarcastically, and we can't tell if the other person's serious. We'll be like, are you serious? You really do like Green Day? Or are you goofing me? That's what we'll be like. We'll be like, are you goofing me or what? So we developed a safe word in our house that we can never break. So if we say the word bomb squad, it means that we're being 100% honest. No lie, no joke, no irony. So I could be like, I don't like chicken, bomb squad. I swear, I don't like chicken. That means 100% I don't like chicken. I'm not just goofing and gagging you around. So Dylan used the word bomb squad in the other of our one night world game, which before him, we banned because this whole game is about telling who's lying and who's telling the truth. So if we bring out our safe word, it kind of destroys the game because you could be like, are you the werewolf? Tell me, bomb squad, and you would have to be like, oh, bomb squad, I am the werewolf. Like, it's a thing that can't be broken in our household. So it cannot be used in the game. And that's what bomb squad means. So thanks for watching, all about Dylan. We'll see you next time. Bye. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, switch to us. Okay, bomb squad. I can't even have a bomb squad. We don't allow bomb squad in this game. Okay, so now I'm a seeer. Dan is a village. Did you switch to that? I said, we're being so plain in this game. Stop saying 100% though. I'm hearing out of the villagers. No, oh my. Yes. We got three villagers. I was a village actor. There's two. I'm gonna do a mic. [SPEAKER_02] Okay [SPEAKER_03] I'm not a squad. I can't even find a squad. We don't allow a squad in the stands. [SPEAKER_02] Okay. [SPEAKER_02] Did you see that? I did. [SPEAKER_03] They're being so played in the middle. Stop saying 100% though. I'm doing it right away. [SPEAKER_02] hhh yeah i was a villager i'm on my side They're claiming privilege So what does it mean? [SPEAKER_01] So one of these three years is a world and you are a world. I think you are well, I wish it [SPEAKER_00] I think you are. Well, then we should definitely vote for Bret in 7 seconds. I think Audrey and Katie are the worst. I think you're the worst. [SPEAKER_01] I think Audrey and Katie are the worst. I think you're the worst. I think the Mac and Luke actually... No, okay, well it doesn't matter. That's not enough time. Oh, this may not work. We gotta wait, do we have any suit for you? [SPEAKER_03] No, okay, well it doesn't matter to you. That's not enough time. Wait, we have an image. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] "}

Because he's playing the whole panel wearable. So I want him to say their heads and the other words. What'd you do, Audrey? I'm a villager. [SPEAKER_02] Joel. Are, George. This Year run started AWPer on Ch sober and tall bald away. Just. Only. [SPEAKER_02] I'm sorry, why are you... [SPEAKER_02] Time of villager. Again. [SPEAKER_01] And [SPEAKER_01] But what we cause in now adds the card. [SPEAKER_02] Okay we're going... [SPEAKER_01] I'm what you were apparently, so it doesn't help you to not say. Well, I think he's worried about me pulling that thing where I'm like, oh, I swapped you. It doesn't relate to me. Because you do that all the time. Because I did it. I will. OK, then I feel like I should say this. I didn't swap you with Ed. I swapped you with someone else. But I did swap you with. Would you swap me with? Why is that matter? I'm just wondering. Oh, I want you to say what your role is. Can you swit your role? Because I might know who certain people are. [SPEAKER_02] Oh, I think he's [SPEAKER_02] Because you do that all the time. [SPEAKER_00] I did it. Okay, then I feel like I should say this. [SPEAKER_02] I did swap it with you swap me with. Why is that matter? I'm just wondering. [SPEAKER_02] role is because I might know. [SPEAKER_02] because you're the robber and you still from them. [SPEAKER_01] Maybe Firstly, I think we've got that [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] We'll see. We'll see how this plans. Oh my god. Why can't you just participate? [SPEAKER_02] \u0414\u043b\u0438\u043d shaken [SPEAKER_00] Oh my god why can't you just participate? Why won't you just participate? That's how you learn game. Oh the other hand why? [SPEAKER_01] other than why is Brett causing all this trouble I'm trying to get that clickbait views I mean it is all about that Okay I want I want causing trouble I swapped you and Dan You swapped me and Dan? swap you and Dan So now I was in Masons Now you're in Masons And let's use a wolf boy [SPEAKER_00] I know where I'm trying to get that clickbait views. I mean, it is all about okay. I won't cut. [SPEAKER_02] to head back for more expert and paid information. Plan whatever receive a message. Please, make sure to share with the dancers and your audience that had the chance to take part in our project, [SPEAKER_02] What do you Monday? [SPEAKER_02] So now he was a mason. Now you're a mason. Unless he's a wolf boy. So then what is stand? I think that makes Daniel my wolf boy. Oh, I know you know [SPEAKER_01] I think that makes sense. Am I a wolf? Oh, no, you're not. No, it's not. Oh! [SPEAKER_00] Oh, is Dan aware? [SPEAKER_01] I saw that Dan was amazing, but did you? He said he was aware of it. You said you were aware of it? [SPEAKER_00] He said he was aware of you said you're aware of He said I think that makes stand aware, but he's smiling when he does it, but he's [SPEAKER_02] But he's but he's did you actually did you actually [SPEAKER_01] Did you actually I feel like maybe Bret and Dylan are both wearable what We need to I was a troublemaker you can watch the video when we when I upload it I go just check you real quick Live stream Either edit the stuff so be well, but then you'll know that I swap Dylan and he's gonna edit himself swapping Dylan [SPEAKER_02] You [SPEAKER_02] I feel like maybe... [SPEAKER_02] What? I think it's a camera. [SPEAKER_00] We need everything. No, I was the troll. [SPEAKER_02] I'm gonna go one for now. Can I go just check you real quick? I'm gonna go one for now. This is a live. [SPEAKER_02] He's gonna edit himself swapping Dylan and him. I can't trust anything anymore. [SPEAKER_01] I can't... [SPEAKER_01] But that's what happened so if Dylan was the world and it's now Dan it feels lying about that It would have mattered because I was the where will doesn't I make care what I am you said villager I know but why do you guys believe me? We're not gonna get the real answer at any anyway, you're just gonna say villager [SPEAKER_00] gonna matter. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] I just want to have a fun one. We're getting in the morning. Hey, next video, that village is going to be out of there. So click the head, guys. I won't get the village address in a mile. Click that like button to get that village address out of there. [SPEAKER_02] We're getting people to burn! [SPEAKER_02] I still get the village address. Click that like button to get that village. Do you make like playlists on your channel? I guess I will for this. I think a next one. [SPEAKER_01] I guess I will for this. [SPEAKER_01] No, no, watch the whole video. Okay, click on my ads. Yeah, what are we talking about ads? So he's the world now. What's the world? I looked in the middle. I saw another villager. So that's only what you saw the villager that means she's [SPEAKER_02] No, no, no, watch the whole video. Okay, click on my ads. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] It's an impressive moments! Because of you [SPEAKER_02] So that's only what you- [SPEAKER_00] m just long in Eddie\u0627\u0631... [SPEAKER_00] No, you're funny. He's so lying. I'm a villager. What is Slide-Daw? I know, I believe it is. What is Slide-Daw? [SPEAKER_01] What is he like, darling? [SPEAKER_01] But what would that help throw me into the bus because I did trouble make them so that means dance now the world So why it doesn't matter but so you're saying you saw villager. I want it off your devil [SPEAKER_00] that out. [SPEAKER_02] wrong man3 from s2 [SPEAKER_02] So why? [SPEAKER_02] I want it out again a little bit of fun. [SPEAKER_01] So that means you're the drunk or the drunk or the drunk or the drunk? Oh wait, did you really? Mm-hmm. Oh you switched me? Wait, wait, what are you? So, okay, so... Wait a minute. I'm just serious. No, you're not serious. I'm just serious. She could have been the drunk and just wanted to go... [SPEAKER_02] marking Army [SPEAKER_02] No. [SPEAKER_00] Wait, what are you? [SPEAKER_02] Okay. [SPEAKER_02] I'm just an actor. No, you're not an actor, I'm a villager. She could have been the drummer just wanting to go. Probably not, though. Dylan, what's your actual trouble making? I did trouble making them. Those two. [SPEAKER_01] Dylan, what's your actual trouble? I did trouble make them. Those two. Under one. Just said. Oh, no, it doesn't add up though. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, it's over 100. The 100 and 1% is very unbelievable. I'm just saying. [SPEAKER_02] 101% [SPEAKER_02] It sounds like a very specific number. It's a werewolf number. So wait, Dylan, were you actually... [SPEAKER_01] It's a werewolf number. Ah! So, wait, Dylan, were you actually the werewolf? I was. Cut yourself a shot. So now, Brad, Dan are werewolves. Why am I a werewolf? Yeah, why is? No, if you're calling me werewolf, that means Dylan would also be werewolf. Yeah, I can say that for you, because I can't trouble him. [SPEAKER_02] Why am I aware? Yeah, why is... [SPEAKER_02] Because I didn't trouble make the Dan or Dylan would so be It seems like Dylan Audrey [SPEAKER_01] it seems like Dylan Audrey were a werewolf and Dylan oddly accidentally blew the cover. Wait, no, Dylan was a werewolf. I know. That's what I'm saying. He accidentally said I looked in the video. We're lying about that. Yeah. So he's saying he's the only werewolf. But if he's not the werewolf, why would he come out of that? Because he is the werewolf. Why would he come out of that? Maybe if one of us is the werewolf, maybe. And Audrey is the werewolf that I wrote to his vote for Audrey. But I feel like we should- I'm not the werewolf of a village. But I don't know if he doesn't want to give us. We know he's the werewolf. Leave the? [SPEAKER_00] Wait, no, Dylan, if Dylan was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_02] No, that's what I'm saying. He accidentally said I looked in. [SPEAKER_02] so [SPEAKER_02] But if he's not there, why would he cause dance the wearable? Why would he cause dance the wearable? [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] I'm not the way I want to tell the truth. This doesn't want to give us. We know. [SPEAKER_02] But I also maybe think that Audrey is guilty now because she's so badly trying to defend her. [SPEAKER_01] We got four new sick researchers and we'll get any last confessions [SPEAKER_02] I'm just throwing out there and no one's asking what I'm doing. Yeah, we have to go. We don't care. [SPEAKER_01] We don't care. Not curious. Not curious. Not curious. Can you hear you, we're all... What are you? Are you 30 seconds? What are you? Can you hear me? [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] What are you? [SPEAKER_00] 30 seconds. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] I got shit face last night so [SPEAKER_01] Alright, let me know if you're okay. You're probably a man, isn't that what you're talking about. [SPEAKER_02] I don't know, I'm going to... [SPEAKER_01] I don't know, I'm going for dead, I don't care what you do. I'm going for dead, I don't care what you do. [SPEAKER_01] I'm going to over dance. I'm going to over dance. Yeah, but why me? I'm the villager. No, that's what villagers say. We know. Yeah, this is what villagers say. We have five seconds. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, it's my villagers. We have five seconds. Okay Audrey You're playing [SPEAKER_01] I'm sorry. I'm fine. Kill him. I'm too fucking dare you."}

[SPEAKER_02] Because I was that um so I was the robber and I took Dylan's card Dylan was the sear so don't let him pull any more I switched our cards times that that somebody wearled [SPEAKER_03] I [SPEAKER_05] Which card card such as that on R.A. \u043d\u0438\u043c's... [SPEAKER_03] would say. Wait, you're going to say it in your book where we're on. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_05] I'm saying you're a werewolf. The way you see. Who's sorry? I'm sorry. [SPEAKER_02] Was it the real thing? [SPEAKER_03] our [SPEAKER_02] Come on. It's so hard because I don't want anybody to feel me move, so I have to do like what's next thing. [SPEAKER_03] I don't want to- [SPEAKER_04] I do like what's next to me. Was there a trouble occurred? Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_05] So you're getting above right? Yeah, which two are, why they're purple? Because that would be hilarious. Well I'll say I hate my role. I just got to wear what my hated too. I was the drunk guy who switched drunk from the middle. [SPEAKER_02] t [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, which to us and our ladies, they're purple, because that would be hilarious. [SPEAKER_03] So [SPEAKER_04] Or what? Mi heat it into. What? Ha the juice. What? [SPEAKER_03] I was the drunk I was the drunk I [SPEAKER_03] Which one? The middle one. [SPEAKER_03] No, he was the CEO Thanks for asking I was really glad watch the second video There was only one Mason so there's another Mason card in the middle. Oh, you're Mason. I was all that myself [SPEAKER_05] Oh no! [SPEAKER_00] Oh no. [SPEAKER_02] and penguin's are my friend he was awesome [SPEAKER_00] Thanks for- [SPEAKER_05] Oh, you're amazing. [SPEAKER_05] So, would you, your climate trauma? [SPEAKER_03] What is that? What's that? [SPEAKER_05] I was like, what's left on the wall? I was like, did you see it? [SPEAKER_04] Home [SPEAKER_03] This was fast. Did you see it? They're over there. You're being very suspicious. [SPEAKER_05] You're being very specific. You're explaining what you do first. I think they're two of the way around. Wait, do we have an insult? [SPEAKER_04] I think they're too. Wait, do we have an insomnia? Well, I was the insomnia. You did defend him the one that you showed me. You did defend him the one that you showed me. I was the insomnia. And when I woke up, I was the Mason, which means that he had a sleep. Yeah, makes a lot of sense because I did such those two cards. [SPEAKER_02] No, he won't use that. You just fed him the one that you showed me. Fend him. [SPEAKER_05] \ud83d\ude09about to continue [SPEAKER_05] That makes a lot of sense because I did switch those two cards. So we're out of the running and so wait [SPEAKER_03] We're out of the running. So wait, were you actually being so on the act though? Boy, we don't know this. [SPEAKER_02] We don't know that she was actually... I mean, F-E? You were the A-C-E? They could have been two... [SPEAKER_05] I mean if he, if he blew it to A C, they could have been two worlds that happened to God. That would have been pretty important. [SPEAKER_02] I was definitely the makes it I think that you're the where we'll then what [SPEAKER_03] Because if there's no way we're allowed to go out. But I could be a Mason. You could, but out of all of us. You know who you know. [SPEAKER_05] But I could be amazing. [SPEAKER_05] bands Since you know how to sing [SPEAKER_04] You said you're the trouble. I'm trouble [SPEAKER_05] I'm Jellomeger I switched these two and there's a little one up so what it sounds like it sounds like If everyone's out there we have no wearables and they're saying the chit there's There's two thirds of a chance of me stealing that [SPEAKER_04] So what it sounds like it's [SPEAKER_03] Ummm cheerstee [SPEAKER_03] Thank you guys, but if you guys kill me with her [SPEAKER_05] But if you guys kill me and I am the Mason, we all wonders. No two terms, there were two in there. And you say you were right. I always need to stop here. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, and you say you were right. I always the insomnia. Now I'm the Mason because I'm okay. Now supposedly I'm the insomnia. [SPEAKER_05] We'll call the end. Now supposedly I am the ex on the internet. But he could have really switched someone else in this, was trying to get Ed to say who it was. But if he was then. [SPEAKER_03] But he could [SPEAKER_00] legroom. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_04] But if he was then that would have been the time. You guys really, you guys really don't. [SPEAKER_05] You guys really, you guys really dunked your goals by just looking at each other. Hi, we're done. We're gonna be kidding. Unless you didn't really do that in you guys. What? That's the best. [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_02] I am. We're done. We can't. Unless you guys. [SPEAKER_03] An inter aquilo de The [SPEAKER_05] So are we just playing the odds on Brett? What were you saying? Yeah, I think I'm gonna vote for you, sorry. Why? But I was Mason. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_03] I think I'm gonna vote for you, sorry. Why? I was Mason, but now I'm the union's on the act, because we could have an act. [SPEAKER_05] But we could have an actual wear if we're lying. Wear a wolf in here. Yeah, well you're doing that. So it's still one of you three. [SPEAKER_00] So it's still one of you. [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, but like you guys are backing each other when you both get where we're [SPEAKER_04] Yeah but like, you guys are back. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] We're not backing each other. We're literally relaying evidence of factual things that we saw on cards. [SPEAKER_04] Get sounds and awful lot like I'm aware, will you just say your were will? [SPEAKER_01] No. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] I'm gonna vote for Brett. Me too. So sorry. But if you vote for me, we're gonna lose. Like, only for the Mason if you're either of the werewolves. You can't say 100% that you're not a werewolf though. So we have no reason not to vote for you. But if you vote for me, y'all will lose if we're... Well, it doesn't matter. We lose it. [SPEAKER_03] But if he goes to his face, he's like, only really amazing. [SPEAKER_03] I can't say 100- [SPEAKER_05] If you've voted me y'all, lose it. What does it matter? [SPEAKER_05] No, because if we all vote to the right we could win. No, no. No, I didn't. [SPEAKER_03] No, no. If you were wearable, then we wouldn't. [SPEAKER_04] careful [SPEAKER_04] There's no wearables over here. [SPEAKER_03] If there's a wearable complaint, we don't kill it then the wearable wins. So we have to kill you. I'm sorry. You guys are just b- [SPEAKER_05] You guys are just banking on me being the worst. Yeah, you're the best. [SPEAKER_03] the [SPEAKER_04] That's two threshing. The 66.6 repeating per se and it's just dead. But like the two are out of home saying is... [SPEAKER_03] Sorry. [SPEAKER_05] But like, here's what I'm saying is, I feel like we're being played. [SPEAKER_03] I feel [SPEAKER_03] By someone he could... [SPEAKER_05] By someone he could he could really like us some our stories like Look I'm gonna touch spot here because I'm voting yeah, I want to win the game still [SPEAKER_03] Our story's like, that's really nice. I like it. I'm gonna jump spot you. Because I'm voting. Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Bye guys. [SPEAKER_03] I'm going to show you that role. [SPEAKER_05] Because if you guys all vote for me, it seems like I'm going to lose no matter what. Well, no. Yeah. Because if you vote for me, I'm the mason, the villagers lose. Yes. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, because if they go from here on them [SPEAKER_05] So you can't win unless we all vote to the right That's not gonna happen so you can't lose a chance of all of those One of two chances of a two and three maybe chance to lust you to a life Which you really might do. I know that's why I feel like we're playing by two worlds Definitely possible Wow [SPEAKER_00] You can't win. [SPEAKER_00] That's not going to happen. Because there's a chance of all of those... [SPEAKER_03] one or two chance to send them to [SPEAKER_03] You really might do. I know that [SPEAKER_04] You [SPEAKER_05] I can do it really easily. [SPEAKER_03] Oh, time to vote! We can kinda show it. Does that have to be... [SPEAKER_05] Does that to be unanimous? [SPEAKER_03] No, I just had to get the toilet ready. I had to get the... [SPEAKER_05] No, I just have to get the most votes. I have to get the most votes. Okay. I guess we can vote now. TIE! [SPEAKER_01] Give me a thumbs up, everyone."}

She needs to be believed for a moment. I am, that's why I'm believing her. Then he would be the robber and... No, he would be the drunk. You robbed my drunk. I robbed you and you're a robber. He would but what? Yeah, what did you do? Yeah, I did. [SPEAKER_01] so you could be something else. So wait, you're probably here because no. [SPEAKER_01] You're out of this first then show. [SPEAKER_01] I swapped you. Yeah, yeah, whatever. Okay. [SPEAKER_01] She's fully [SPEAKER_01] No, he would be the drunk, so you robbed my dog. And that was he- [SPEAKER_00] Okay. See that.

[SPEAKER_01] Did you see this? When they... [SPEAKER_00] Only two. Only two. Okay. That was a deal. So it's Brett and him. It's gotta be Brett. Kelsey? We have to definitely be Brett. No, because what I'm saying is... What are you saying? What are you saying? I would not lie about being a robber. Unless I was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] That was a deal. So it's Brett and him. It's gotta be Brett. I think we have to definitely. No, because what I want is that thing. What do you say? [SPEAKER_00] Which is what we're saying. Why would you say something like 5 feet was over? I... Can't see story makes zero sense whatsoever. What are you just because you claimed Trump-Liger? No, because she claimed that she stole the dander.

Me, I'm a drunk. She just dwindled out. She just dwindled out. Oh, these 30 seconds left. I think we have to. I think we have to. I think we have to. The only person who backed your drunk store up with him, which you're now claiming that was never a robber. So it sounds like you're aware of too. Well, no, he just guessed lucky. No, I said I was drunk before he said that he robbed my car. That's why. Yeah, you're drunk. Yeah, he said that he was a robber after I said that I was drunk. I'm OK. We have to vote.

I looked at his card because he's a wild card and I want to know what he was before you can go around. Wait, then if you were the seeker, then you're lying about being a sheezer. Uh, but why would you believe him? She's either a tanner or a real one. [SPEAKER_00] Wait, then if you were the seeker, then you're lying about being a sheezy. Uh, but why would you believe him? She's either a Tanner or a real one. Because he just said that he's the robber. Okay, we're in the... [SPEAKER_01] Okay, we're gonna have to be playing us. Because you're not too ruff either, you're ruff. Me, I saw where I'm from. Oh, you've learned so much lie. You don't. Were you a werewolf? You don't get lucky and see too ruff. Doesn't it last round?

There's a- [SPEAKER_01] I don't believe that he robbed anybody. Because he wasn't the robber. He was the robber? No, he might have been the robber, but I don't believe that he was the robber. Well now he's not the robber. Let's find out. Well, a clue. Did you spot cards with anyone? Why would I swap cards with a werewolf of all things like you are? I'm not aware of it. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. You are too. See, the thing is, when he robbed, he knows the card is. So he won't say that he robbed it. Yeah, because he knows it's probably a thing. See, the thing is a werewolf. What do you think? That's true. I don't want you to be more remaining. The way she was lying like a monster, it had to be chance of werewolf. So who do we vote for? You?

[SPEAKER_03] I could be my default- [SPEAKER_03] You drunk dangerous car you drunk dangerous drunk car [SPEAKER_01] My real card was pretty dangerous. What was your real card? I don't wanna get it.

[SPEAKER_02] Both of us can't be tenors, it's only one tenor, can't we? [SPEAKER_02] Both of those camping minions is only one minion card. So we'll take one of these minions, one of these, and two? I would so. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_03] So we'll say one of you isn't anyone of you isn't Tanya? I was a robber. He took my trouble maker. He confirmed my trouble maker. [SPEAKER_00] I was a rock. [SPEAKER_03] Who do you, so you know you're confirming your trouble maker? I mean I was, you saw it. [SPEAKER_00] Who did we, so now you're... [SPEAKER_03] You stole my card.

Yeah. [SPEAKER_03] The thing is we're on the same team here. We're on the same village team. We need to figure out which one of these ding dong's to vote for. Because either they're both werewolves or one of them's a minion. We don't want to vote for the minion. We don't want to vote for the tanner either. But they're not letting out. [SPEAKER_00] The thing is we're on the same team here. We're on the same field. This team. We need to figure out. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] We don't want to vote for... [SPEAKER_00] meaning we don't want to go [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_03] I'm assuming there would. Oh minute. [SPEAKER_02] I'm assuming there was a minute and a half. So what did you do for it? Yeah, we did. [SPEAKER_03] So what did you do? [SPEAKER_03] I switch YouTube. [SPEAKER_02] you to. And how do you feel about that? Good at the time but bad. [SPEAKER_03] Good at the time but bad now! I want to mess with him. He's so new to the arts and expert at the game. I don't want to mess with the expert. [SPEAKER_00] I wanna mess with you. [SPEAKER_00] Hmm. [SPEAKER_00] \ub05d. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Jordan always makes friends. [SPEAKER_02] Interesting. Well, this is interesting. So, if you guys want to say anything... [SPEAKER_03] If you guys want to say anything [SPEAKER_03] One minute remaining. She came right out of the gate, said he was the... Well, but I think he heard me tell me, because I didn't make a little scratch. No, I was... No, I was... I just like it there for a minute. Yeah, I certainly like... God! I got like that. I'm not hearing that. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] This is how you do it as well. [SPEAKER_02] No, I was like, I was like, I get there for a while. Yeah, I still like... [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] Actually almost for the sleep now. I was like, you almost forgot that you came around the games [SPEAKER_03] You almost forget that. You came around and the game said he was a world famous, and I think he's a minion. So now I'm near the minions over here, but maybe I don't know. [SPEAKER_03] I guess we go for Deandre, they're just gonna both. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_03] It doesn't matter. It's going to be tight. It's most likely going to be tied. They're going to team up on someone we need a team up on someone. [SPEAKER_00] We tied there. [SPEAKER_03] Alright, who do you want to go with? I don't know. Are you gonna see Andre? Deandre, alright. It's been 10 seconds. Wait, wow. [SPEAKER_00] I don't know. I guess the Andre... [SPEAKER_02] family \uc601\uc0c1\u00f3w\ub3c4 [SPEAKER_02] But why don't we not go up again? Because we know that she's a world. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_03] You had five minutes to tell us why we should vote for Katie. Well, I said all the word from beginning, you said you Trump made both of us. Yeah, but then she said she was the world. [SPEAKER_02] it gonna happen [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, but I'm she's the choose the world."}

[SPEAKER_05] I wanna know what Deandre did. I wanna know now. [SPEAKER_04] Oh man, again? Again, who's lying? [SPEAKER_05] again. [SPEAKER_05] That's it. [SPEAKER_04] is he now? [SPEAKER_04] Well Ryan. [SPEAKER_04] What did you do as the children maker? [SPEAKER_01] whoooo she can do that [SPEAKER_01] Yes, but this one. [SPEAKER_03] So I'm guessing you were a robber then. Yes, yeah. Um, I swapped yours in, uh, in Brex's car. [SPEAKER_01] So pretty reminding.. [SPEAKER_04] I wanna know what you were. NOOOO! [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_03] \u00bfNo es el takeno de los harmful? [SPEAKER_04] Parties. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_04] What is that? There's no way you can be a wear wolf again. In a wear wolf like three times. [SPEAKER_05] I may not have been a werewolf, but it doesn't mean I didn't want. [SPEAKER_05] 3 minutes. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not playing the fifth on that. [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_05] But what were you? You're a robber? Now I'm the robber? [SPEAKER_04] So deandre is just claiming drunk. [SPEAKER_05] So Deandre just claimed to drunk over here. [SPEAKER_03] Niet gaan wel mee contest... [SPEAKER_00] This is supposed to happen. I don't know if I've ever railed in like this before but this is like the most maternal feeling ever. [SPEAKER_05] Okay, so what really happened? [SPEAKER_00] I was the rubber and I saw this jump maker. [SPEAKER_05] Any trail maybe in here? Some Shimp over here or the world's wind? [SPEAKER_05] because she meant an over there. [SPEAKER_05] I'm one of them. You're minting. Minting. Minting. Minting. The question is, do we vote for him? Because he's claiming drunk, but he might have been a world. But if he was a drunk, then he's drunk until the end. I'm a little yellow. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_04] You might have been a whorel, but if he was a drunk thing he's drunk into a whorel. I'm a little yellow guy. Banana. [SPEAKER_04] That's what it means. [SPEAKER_00] So what's going on there? [SPEAKER_03] So what's going on? That's when we believe that Bern is actually the dominion because he might actually have been the Turner. In which case he still doesn't want the first to go for her because she would have the Turner partner. She would then have the Turner partner. So we should. [SPEAKER_05] within have a ten of them. So we shouldn't vote for Katie. [SPEAKER_05] Because if she was aware of how we could hold her out, we'd do it. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_03] I guess that's the right, yeah, I guess that's the reason why you keep 10 and million in a game. Because either way the question is what- [SPEAKER_05] The question is what did you do, Deontary? Were you wolfin' or were you actually drunken? [SPEAKER_03] in Tampa. In the [SPEAKER_01] Narrator greatest [SPEAKER_04] Interesting. [SPEAKER_00] I think we're not doing this again. [SPEAKER_04] Can't wait, what happened? [SPEAKER_05] I have a confession to breathe. Of course, of course she does. I was, I don't know if I trust Ryan. Ryan did you swap us? Mm-hmm. KD9? You need real here? You need a full real? [SPEAKER_00] Oh, do we ever tell him that like most of the cards you don't have? [SPEAKER_04] have to do the action. Because like the app says you may swap two cards. Like it has the trouble maker. He didn't actually have to swap two. But he swaps. [SPEAKER_05] fake cast the jump [SPEAKER_01] This Protest George [SPEAKER_05] But he swat Kiana. I was the Tanner. So we don't want to vote for Kiana. Now here's the thing, that means... [SPEAKER_05] Uh, Deandre could be the minion. No, so we should vote if you're telling the truth. Me and you should vote for Deandre. Sounds like it's when. Unless he is a villager, then we're gonna lose. But it seems like we're gonna lose anyway if he is a villager. Because if he's a minion, then he wants one of us to die. Which, uh, I don't know if it sounds like it's gonna happen. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] is a minion that he wants one of us to die. [SPEAKER_05] So we shall offer deodorant again. [SPEAKER_05] That's the actually really close to you. It's just, it's just, it's just, it's really... One minute, it's really... [SPEAKER_01] Deriach above forty. [SPEAKER_02] It took one minute to reline. [SPEAKER_00] Trim. I feel like you wouldn't be lying. If... [SPEAKER_05] If not, then you'd want to work with you to live with your friends. Either way, you'd say you'd want to go with your friends. [SPEAKER_03] Either way, she doesn't want to go for him. She has to, that means you have the troublemaker, right? And she should have the tanning. Yeah, so we don't want to go for it, because only then I should have the robber. [SPEAKER_05] of Ofer because only I should have the robber. Then he has mystery card. Mystery card. It's either meaning the werewolf or drunk. [SPEAKER_03] It's either meaningful or... [SPEAKER_05] No. [SPEAKER_05] Snake.\" did [SPEAKER_02] only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_05] I guess we should vote for him because I can't think of what else he would be other than a werewolf or a minion because if he was a drunk then it's obviously in the half. [SPEAKER_05] I don't know what happened to state your case. I think we caught you. [SPEAKER_01] I don't know what it happened to stay- [SPEAKER_05] Why do you say backwards? You said you were the drunk and then that means wear, open, minion, or the only cards in the middle. [SPEAKER_05] Katie, do you care at all? I don't care. This is heaven."}

[SPEAKER_02] No, stop touching my cheek! Oh my god! That wasn't your dick. Alright, I'm this. We're back. [SPEAKER_02] Okay, I almost looked at it. But I did not. That's like when you have a card usually you want to look at it. Yeah. Yeah. Alright, what do we know? Well Shane's a werewolf look at him. I'm not. [SPEAKER_01] I'm not, he's sitting in like, he's distancing himself from his card. When I'm not as fast asleep. [SPEAKER_02] When I was a villager, you were a villager. So was I. Main and simple. [SPEAKER_01] Bye. Bye. [SPEAKER_00] and simple. [SPEAKER_00] Who's the seer? [SPEAKER_00] But they might not be a series. [SPEAKER_02] Do I see it? It might not be a series. Yeah, it might be in the middle. [SPEAKER_01] might be in the middle. [SPEAKER_01] Oh, but nobody's capping to that. Anybody trouble making? [SPEAKER_02] a robin [SPEAKER_03] I was a robber I switched with Eric. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, guys, if Shane is truthful in what he just said, this game's over because I'm no longer a wearable from a person I know he's a wearable from them. I know I'm the only one. It's gonna be great. So let's just finish this real quick [SPEAKER_00] You switched with me. Yes. So now you could be a werewolf. If you switched with me, you are a werewolf and you are the only werewolf and we should kill Shane. And I think you fucked it Shane. Because I- [SPEAKER_02] that way from here [SPEAKER_02] me [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_03] if [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] That's why you might not want to be or he's looking deadly [SPEAKER_01] or he's looking- But we're truly truthful. He's looking for this opportunity. Him and Aaron might both be werewolves, and he's protecting Aaron. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Eric? You mean? Yeah. In Aaron? I have no affiliations or ties to this man. I don't know. I don't know. He was reveling in Eric's plan. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I have no fear. [SPEAKER_01] I know he was reveling. [SPEAKER_02] I mean, that's good. But the thing though is, I believe Eric, because I know how frustrated Shane will be. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] And I want to see that happen. If what Shane said is true, then I was the werewolf. I looked at that card because no one else was a friend of mine. [SPEAKER_02] to be that happy. [SPEAKER_00] And that was a villager. [SPEAKER_01] and incidentalia [SPEAKER_00] Ok, so [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] and if Shane is truthful and that he took my card and switched our cards that is now a werewolf and he will be happy [SPEAKER_02] be happy to die. I can't take it back. I was a rubber. I was like this. So in this scenario then Eric now is the rubber then Shane is the werewolf. Calvin is a villager and Rick is a villager. [SPEAKER_03] Cause I have your kind of.. Did I do that I like this?I hate it [SPEAKER_01] Everybody seems to be good, except Shane swapped with Eric. Now there's doubt there. Who is what and what's who? [SPEAKER_01] I think I'm gonna trust Eric. Dislating the game, telling him, telling everyone that he was a werewolf and now she's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] That's good, right? If we kill him, then everything's good. [SPEAKER_01] Shane should look at his card. [SPEAKER_02] I know Rick is a villager because I was a seer and I looked at Rick to know if I could trust this man. I didn't see him do that. [SPEAKER_00] no rig- [SPEAKER_01] Whatever. [SPEAKER_00] like a trussist man. It seemed to be okay. I think we should all just hang change. Call it a change. [SPEAKER_02] I think this is quick. Change the web off. Hey. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Vou, e n\u00e9? [SPEAKER_03] I play my hand to early. I sigh. [SPEAKER_01] Play my hand thoroughly.

[SPEAKER_03] Could be a thing that happened. [SPEAKER_01] And then now he's the werewolf and well air knows [SPEAKER_02] Are there the police? Eric knows the end. There it goes there it goes. [SPEAKER_01] Eric knows the end. [SPEAKER_03] Was he the robber? [SPEAKER_01] So, Travis and I, we can go to a vote right away. [SPEAKER_02] is the villager. [SPEAKER_02] Can you confirm that?

[SPEAKER_03] Can you answer each of you here? I don't know. Was he the rock? No, he was not the rock. Yeah [SPEAKER_02] He was the robber. He was the robber. [SPEAKER_01] I was the Roger. I was the villager. And he didn't steal from Justin. Nope, he'd pull. So he could've stole from Paul, but I think he stole from me. I was not the Roger. I was the villager.

And you switched it. I switched it. [SPEAKER_00] And you said... Switch us in. How are you actually the trouble maker? [SPEAKER_02] Okay, Good bye. [SPEAKER_00] I'm gonna guess [SPEAKER_03] I'm gonna guess there's an insomniac out there and they can verify that's a great Which do we have an insomniac? Yeah, so I am saying it was you too So if you were an insomniac you could verify it or one of you two were insomniac you can verify that he's a little battered [SPEAKER_04] That's a- [SPEAKER_00] the greatest, which we have in inside. So I am saying it was [SPEAKER_04] battery. [SPEAKER_02] a lot. So who is is there in the same and so may I cut the table? [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_02] I'm gonna go out on a limb, oh sorry! And do this. I started as a werewolf. Oh. [SPEAKER_03] Oh, fascinating. So now which one of us is? Which one of us is telling the truth? Wood. Okay. So, so we just see one of us is one of these. [SPEAKER_01] So we see one of us. [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_01] So who's the see why would you think that? [SPEAKER_03] We can't both be a troublemaker, so one of us is lying, and these are the two roles that lie. [SPEAKER_04] We can't both be a troublemaker. So one of us is... [SPEAKER_04] fuck okay so would I lie to the villager [SPEAKER_01] I don't know, I've been lying as a villager before. [SPEAKER_03] All right. I think you're the Tanner. I think you're the world. And now I think you're the Tanner. And I think you is whatever you used to be. And you're probably a bit older. So you did that. You are. [SPEAKER_04] Oh [SPEAKER_00] So you did that. You are claiming you did the switch. Yes. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_04] They like touch fingers together just need like, I was just like for real. I did this. This is real, this is real. This is real. Oh yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. Okay. [SPEAKER_01] Is this like real again? This is real? Is this real? [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, yeah, oh yeah. [SPEAKER_04] Okay. [SPEAKER_04] So [SPEAKER_04] Here's what I'm thinking is gone down. Okay, I'm a villager. Or I'm like on the side of the villager. Here's the thing. I think Mike was the robber. [SPEAKER_00] I'm a builder. [SPEAKER_04] uh... all was a tanner [SPEAKER_04] They Mike took Paul's role of the Tanner. [SPEAKER_03] Mm hmm. [SPEAKER_04] They're both playing the Tanner game. [SPEAKER_00] Hmm, they both do I like it To be continued [SPEAKER_01] That's true. [SPEAKER_02] I'm not playing a tenor game. I started as a wearable. I don't think I'm wearing more. Why not? Because there's two troubling potentially. [SPEAKER_04] Why not? [SPEAKER_04] So you switch... [SPEAKER_01] There's a 50-50 chance that what were you, you're the whereabouts? Yeah, you'll see me. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, you have to get some info. [SPEAKER_04] I was in Salmiac. [SPEAKER_03] Did you wake up? That was in Sonic. Yes. Ah. Bingo. Shibou. They got switched. So that was my story. So why is he lying? He's either a robber and grabbed the werewolf, or he is a werewolf or something. No, I think he was a robber that grabbed. [SPEAKER_01] Shibu, they got switched to that right in my story. So why is he like... [SPEAKER_04] I think it was the robber that grabbed the Tanner. [SPEAKER_02] I think so too. [SPEAKER_03] So to make you a Tanner now which would make [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] No, what were you? No, there's another obvious role. [SPEAKER_02] in the board that has no knowledge of what so we were you something because trust me if I was this [SPEAKER_00] Trust me if I was this [SPEAKER_03] So you can write it as possible. I switched it to YouTube. So I'm saying here, Tanner, because he was a Tanner. [SPEAKER_00] But what if I robbed? What if I was the robber and I robbed a... [SPEAKER_01] and I'm just trying to throw off the game. If he, if you... [SPEAKER_02] Rob a bad thing he switched you after. Mm-hmm. Yes, yes. That's true. So what were you before you got switched? What were you? [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_04] Yes, sir. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, that's true. So why did what we're [SPEAKER_02] I was the villager. [SPEAKER_02] You robbed him? Yeah. Bye. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, no, that's what you're saying. No, I didn't rob [SPEAKER_01] I'm a civilian. [SPEAKER_02] In your world. No. That's... But why did you... Why did you clean trouble me?

[SPEAKER_02] I don't want to incriminate so- Now there's no more- [SPEAKER_03] Yeah.

[SPEAKER_02] I will confirm I never switch to with anybody. Okay, so you still have that not good role? I assume... [SPEAKER_03] that somebody else didn't switch me. [SPEAKER_00] Just where are you?

[SPEAKER_05] And then you saw just back. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] So then Paul, so that means Paul is a word for Tanner and he's a minion because he saying he's had a role that's claimed. So you think, what do you think he is? A word will for a Tanner because he says one of the roles is claimed. Everyone else is not very much verified. [SPEAKER_02] Birds chirping, morning, night, time room, [SPEAKER_05] you can't what do you think he is [SPEAKER_05] and you're sticking with me. So... [SPEAKER_03] No hold on I have to figure out how to do this right. [SPEAKER_02] No, hold on. [SPEAKER_03] But yes, so far I am sticking. Okay? [SPEAKER_00] Okay, and L. Okay, so the three of us, I will- [SPEAKER_05] So the kid is card and you can verify that I was zero right? Yes, because I... [SPEAKER_01] because I took your C-R-C-R-C-R. Yeah. [SPEAKER_05]  [SPEAKER_00] and he was coffee cat. [SPEAKER_00] What's that all to do? [SPEAKER_00] What is that? What kind of job for making shit? Yes, like, do you swear to double-holster, nothing but truth? Yes! So how do we go? [SPEAKER_04] The lawyer is like, all right, we're gonna do that again. I mean, let me talk to him. [SPEAKER_02] James, you switched Tyler and Mitchell? Yeah, that's so cool. Okay, I think I'm going to believe him. What? Tyler was one of the werewolves. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, I'm in time to believe. [SPEAKER_02] and you are now a world. Totally not if James switched you. Why do you say that? Because I was the minion. But why do you? And there's another world out there and I'm not gonna out them. There's three of us though. Like we will win. [SPEAKER_01] More connection, memory, antena. [SPEAKER_02] \u60c5\u51b5\ub9c8\ub9ac\ufffdBu [SPEAKER_05] We have to vote. Was it him? [SPEAKER_05] or was it him? You don't really... [SPEAKER_04] You were never the fucking seer, were you? [SPEAKER_05] He knows what that I was yeah, I don't see your card He didn't rob through you who was it. There's no way your story doesn't check out he was a Tanner [SPEAKER_01] I don't even see your card. Eat in Rob. [SPEAKER_05] We can't vote for him from the gay- [SPEAKER_00] We can't vote for him. From the get go. Yeah. [SPEAKER_04] Now the question is why to be lied to you. [SPEAKER_02] Doesn't matter, we kill Mitch. [SPEAKER_05] But it doesn't matter because you can verify me. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, we kill Mitchell, we kill Mitchell. [SPEAKER_05] No, no, we're just un- I'm verified. I'm voting. You gotta kill Tyler [SPEAKER_00] You're verified by a liar no you have to kill oh You get a kill Mitchell no no, yeah, let's kill Mitchell.

I saw two cards in the middle. [SPEAKER_00] your claim production. [SPEAKER_00] What cars you see in the middle? [SPEAKER_01] I saw at least one werewolf in the middle. [SPEAKER_00] That's all that happened. So you caught the cat into this year? Wow, he's claiming to. I'm gonna just put this here. That's okay. That's all good. I'm just gonna...

Uh, sure, I was a trauma maker. How about you now? Ooh. [SPEAKER_00] I wasn't that. [SPEAKER_00] So wherever he pushed away the rubber the last good roll here. Okay, so how you you saw a wearable from the center [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] James were in trouble. I saw a world from the center. So the only way he could have done that is by being aware of it. Right? I'm not sure. Or assuming what you're saying is true. Yeah, assuming what I'm saying is true. That's all believed in my lie. Or where I could be lying. He could be. [SPEAKER_01] Let's go then. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, so we were not saying... [SPEAKER_00] Is there a robber out there? So what the fuck is going on here? Don't give me. Alright. Is there a robber out there? He's made so fun long. Come on, Mike. I don't know. I feel like we have three baddies here. I didn't switch. I didn't switch you. [SPEAKER_01] Is there a rubber out there? [SPEAKER_00] Good. [SPEAKER_00] Why should I believe you? Because I'm telling the truth. Cool, you should. [SPEAKER_01] You should it. I was the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_00] How's line? [SPEAKER_00] I have nothing else to say about that. You made sure? Yeah. Put it just... [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, who did you rob from? [SPEAKER_00] That's a minion confirmation right there. Oh. So it is the... Pardon? Paul's tan. Oh, that's a good guess. [SPEAKER_01] and\u65b0\u805e. [SPEAKER_00] I rock them all. [SPEAKER_00] but you said you weren't the robber. And now your claimant to be robber after someone's promsied to claim robber, so you have no original thought in your head. That's right. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Okay. Okay. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, okay. Yeah, yeah, you're up for me. Yeah. We're in trouble. Yeah. We're here. The only thing is one of them is not going to win. They're going to think they're going to win and they're going to lose and we can't lose. You're up for me. [SPEAKER_01] We can't do rock or anything. You know what your role is. We are going to vote for. [SPEAKER_00] Good question. [SPEAKER_00] Not sure yet. [SPEAKER_00] You said you trouble me people. I did but you haven't revealed it correct and I'm likely not going to because Hopefully it'll make one of them realize they're gonna lose and we might start to get some info and if not I'm just gonna vote okay So you're gonna hold on I'll tell James at the last second in the center. That's really like really no no, are you running for? [SPEAKER_01] I did, but you haven't revealed it. Cur- [SPEAKER_01] if not I'm just gonna vote okay so [SPEAKER_01] Hold on. What's up Jameson?

Sure, sure. Well, for fun. Well, I guess since he's not going to tell us who he drummed made, I think it's Justin. Yeah. It's got to be. Sure, sure. But what if that's a Tanner play? [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, yeah sure sure well for fun [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, it's gotta be, sure, sure. But what if that's a tender play? [SPEAKER_01] from Justin. [SPEAKER_00] Justin? I don't think Justin's playing Tanner. I'm not. [SPEAKER_00] I don't think he's playing Taker for it. It's okay, we're gonna watch this. If it is, it's like the Earth. It's a very small, it doesn't matter. We have two werewolves in the minion. [SPEAKER_01] It's okay, we're gonna- If it is, it's gonna be a very small- Did you trouble me? [SPEAKER_00] I'm sorry, we've lost. [SPEAKER_00] Was anyone actually the copycat? So Justin here? Because I was just the robber and I robbed from you. Yeah, he just beat me to death.

You have a meeting to reduce the time, for you to roll. Is that three seconds? Sometimes we could have two. I put it at three because we had a new... Sometimes we even got a one thing. Yeah, so... I think we can do one. I keep forgetting to put it down. So, remind me before we start the next game. [SPEAKER_00] Where did he go again? [SPEAKER_00] Sometimes we could only do two. [SPEAKER_00] I put it at three because we had a new something. Sometimes we even go to one. Yeah, so I think we can do. I keep. [SPEAKER_00] So we have, okay, what the flag? [SPEAKER_00] So we have Cier, James St. He and Cier, Laura St. He's on the Accommodation, he's Robert Paul and I've said nothing. James is a Tanner and a Where-O from the Center. But I will say that I... [SPEAKER_02] Bye! [SPEAKER_02] switched with Mitch and that's why he is the rubber now and I'm in some yak because I was the rubber That's a lot of information all I want you verify or No [SPEAKER_01] new video, sure, so that was our video. [SPEAKER_01] You did that. Yeah, I don't give a shit about you guys. Oh, I see that's more that you get more information [SPEAKER_00] When you did that, yeah, I don't give a shit about you guys. Oh, I can see you good. That's more that [SPEAKER_02] I can confess someone is lying someone has taken my role and put it somewhere No, I'm one of the I'm one of the things on the board. Oh shit. You're the Tanner no [SPEAKER_00] light. [SPEAKER_00] were [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] I'm the seer, obviously. [SPEAKER_00] What are you doing? [SPEAKER_01] What are you Paul? That makes no sense. Yeah. Paul is a werewolf. Do you need to be two chicks? No, we need to be guaranteed. [SPEAKER_00] There we do this two checks no I can be guarantee [SPEAKER_02] Paul, okay, fair. Because what you said makes no sense. One of you has taken- Including these? Yeah, including these. Took one of my roles and put it on here. Obviously not the werewolf, because it could just be the other one if that person. But somebody's lying about one of these. [SPEAKER_00] I haven't said anything yet. Yes, we know. Okay, yeah, let's bring it up, Justin. What would you like to say? Highly suspicious. Okay. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] Yes, okay, yeah, let's bring it up [SPEAKER_02] You'll understand, highly suspicious. But you'll understand when I explain who I am. Okay. Yeah, we'll leave it to 30 seconds before the... I won't. I'll go to the studio. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] I'll go to the studio. [SPEAKER_01] I'm sure you're gonna have a turn. I would, yeah, I would lead a troublemaker in there. So nobody was... [SPEAKER_02] You gonna head turn? I would get out of the way. That would lead to trouble maker. So nobody was a trouble maker, nobody switched anything. Is that what we're saying? [SPEAKER_02] I buy this, that sounds like that, Panzo. You're obviously lying. Nope, yes, I was a seer. You're a liar. I was a seer. Okay, 100%. No, you're a dirty liar. I know. James, can I ask a question? Yeah. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] I know James can I ask a question yeah this Tanner in the center are you maybe lying to try to go to information is Paul maybe the Tanner? No, okay, so the Tanner yeah, I'm not [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I'm not smart enough to play that way. [SPEAKER_00] So that's a good idea though. Can you put a bit of hugged you for no reason? What did I say? Oh I slapped my body. [SPEAKER_02] What did I say? Oh, I'm sorry. What did I say we should do if we're the seer? I don't know. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] I don't- what? Look at James. But James can't look at himself because of the syrup. I know. Because he wasn't. [SPEAKER_02] Look at James. [SPEAKER_02] I know because he wasn't I was and I loved James. What did you see? He's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_01] 100% clearly one of them is the Tanner. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I can agree with this. Now, here's the case. [SPEAKER_01] Now here's okay, so why don't you turn your wounds to your [SPEAKER_01] The Tanner did call out too, but these are two easy ones to call out. What? Tanner's no one's gonna be like, oh, I was the... [SPEAKER_00] More. [SPEAKER_02] I don't want, because no one's gonna be like, oh, I'm gonna be like, I was the Tanner. I would want you to vote for me. I don't want you to vote for me. I don't want you to vote for James. [SPEAKER_02] Justin is the only possible werewolf at this point because I know what he is and I feel really good about what you guys are That's true [SPEAKER_00] That's true. And no one's called a trouble maker. So if here's the thing though, I don't want you to kill me because I don't think there's a werewolf here. I only think there's a Tanner here. Right? So if you kill me. [SPEAKER_02] so if [SPEAKER_00] I have to vote for somebody. [SPEAKER_02] I think don't vote for him. I think that's the thing. [SPEAKER_00] That's a thing. Don't kill me because I'm gonna have to take something else with me. I'm gonna stick to my belt for Justin. Uh-uh. [SPEAKER_02] with me. He was sick to my bones for Justin. I will. No, listen. Oh my this one totally no, no, no, one more life. I was the Tanner. No, I was gonna say tell me. But no, don't kill me. [SPEAKER_01] Oh [SPEAKER_00] Oh my, this was totally null without. No, that one didn't play if I was the 10. [SPEAKER_00] No, this is this is what I [SPEAKER_02] I saw 100%. I saw that. Solid Tanner strategy to just go with his original lie, but not put any... I think they're both playing me, fine. I guess you did this. [SPEAKER_00] both playing fine, suspicious and likely games. Yeah, let's be real. Yeah, I agree. James came out first. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, let's be real hungry. [SPEAKER_02] renderless [SPEAKER_02] Here's the thing, promise for 100%. You did. [SPEAKER_02] and building quality. [SPEAKER_02] This is James's go-to, like I know from past games, this is go-to Tanner Peace. [SPEAKER_00] This is- [SPEAKER_00] No, really, no. That was a different time. Every time James' tan said he's dead, he said he's been dead. No, not okay. Yeah, if it wasn't. I don't pay attention to that. I'm walking about to this game. Okay. What do you vote? Okay. More likely to go poll. [SPEAKER_02] That's a different time. Every time I change it. [SPEAKER_01] That was damn temp temp temp he said he's been aftermath. No not again yeah [SPEAKER_02] I don't play attention to that. I'm walking about just this game. Okay. What do you vote? [SPEAKER_00] If it's just these two? [SPEAKER_02] I was the fucking fear and I'm gonna get killed. That's mental. No, that's mental. Okay, we only have one minute or three seconds. Okay, 100% is that James is the Tanner? No, Gilmitch. Yeah. James is the Tanner. I was the savior. So you're the roger, aren't you? [SPEAKER_00] I'm gonna get the show, that's a lot of men. [SPEAKER_01] \u3073oted [SPEAKER_00] So you're the wrong one? I'm definitely. I was and let me switch. And you will. I can verify this. I will. [SPEAKER_01] And you will I can verify this I woke up as robber Now Paul did say he agrees with this That's something I don't it's not a lot guys do a forward. Who's everyone going for? I'm voting for Jason I'm voting left [SPEAKER_00] scared Paul [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, but that's something I don't it's not a lot guys do a vote. Who's everyone going for? I'm voting for Jason I'm voting left Well, don't for a left [SPEAKER_02] I don't... [SPEAKER_01] kr\u00f3tin dared listens- It's"}

Yeah. Wow, we... [SPEAKER_01] Wow, we have boring [SPEAKER_01] And Mason's is anyone want to do the Mason for the first time? I know there is a Mason out there. [SPEAKER_02] I know there is a mason out there. [SPEAKER_01] How do you know that? [SPEAKER_02] the makes. [SPEAKER_01] And there's no like no, he thought the seer was in here and I was just like uh oh [SPEAKER_02] Now I was amazing and I woke up alone and I scanned real quick and I went back before as I panicked because there was no other amazing I felt alone. [SPEAKER_01] I was el hunter. [SPEAKER_02] el orientation radar. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_04] So that's what you think? There is a little bit more. Somewhere in the center. Somewhere. [SPEAKER_01] Somewhere in the center. Somewhere. And I. And James. James, they haven't said anything. [SPEAKER_04] I [SPEAKER_01] So you're one of the four. [SPEAKER_01] One of the three. One of the three, okay. James, are you one of the three or one of the one? [SPEAKER_04] Tough question. [SPEAKER_04] I'm gonna see what Paul says. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_01] I'm so sick. [SPEAKER_04] Oh, this is hilarious. Down in the middle of the road you say something. [SPEAKER_01] This is hilarious. [SPEAKER_03] Fucking alright, oh five minutes, I don't care [SPEAKER_02] I love playing with James. I will also. All right, so should we go to vote? I just want for the person with the roles in front of them. [SPEAKER_04]  [SPEAKER_02] with both. Sure [SPEAKER_01] But you can also be the Tanner unless he's using that as a camera flash. [SPEAKER_01] I just don't get this. Well, we'll always have- If one of them is the troublemaker... [SPEAKER_02] You know maybe again, you know? [SPEAKER_01] they want to talk. [SPEAKER_01] Otherwise, they're not playing to the intention of the game of winning. [SPEAKER_00] So neither of them is the trouble leader. [SPEAKER_02] Fascinating. Fascinating. [SPEAKER_00] Fascinating. [SPEAKER_01] Video [SPEAKER_01] So [SPEAKER_00] Bye. [SPEAKER_00] Which I mean, are you where we'll want or where we'll have to make it? What we've done, the troll, thank you. [SPEAKER_02] I mean... [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] Cool. So yeah, nobody. [SPEAKER_03] Nobody nobody I realized I was just like eyes closed like a couple maker closed your ass like oh fuck [SPEAKER_01] I just missed my- Either he's doing another James Tanner, he wants to go 4x4. Or he's James Troublemaker and forgot to open his eyes. [SPEAKER_02] I believe that's a possibility. So then Paul's one of these- I was just hoping I could- [SPEAKER_03] I was just hoping that's the only information and being able to give is that I was the trope maker in Paul's novel. [SPEAKER_01] I was just hoping I could... [SPEAKER_02] It is one of these three. I mean it's 60% chance he's aware what let's fucking just kill him Slow down. We'll slow down. Damn. Let's look at everyone else's stories. I mean this it's all of us [SPEAKER_03] Let's fucking just kill him. [SPEAKER_01] All of us are unfurled as well. There are no lawyers in the company. [SPEAKER_02] I'm a computer store. He hasn't spoken. I suspect he is one of the three. [SPEAKER_01] I think he's a Tanner. I think he's a Tanner. Let's vote left [SPEAKER_01] Let's do it. [SPEAKER_01] I don't think it James is the Tanner. [SPEAKER_01] because he's saying vote left and that's a very noble thing to do. [SPEAKER_01] Thank you. [SPEAKER_01] And you actually forgot to switch anybody. You didn't switch anybody. No. Okay. [SPEAKER_03] actually forgot to switch any [SPEAKER_00] and we... [SPEAKER_02] I think just the odds are 60% chance, we're 30% chance, it's a Tanner. Like those are the odds. Let's get out of here. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_04] Like those weird odds, that's why I said like... [SPEAKER_01] let's gank him. What a bit of a day. No, but he'd be talking if he was a werewolf. If he's a Tanner, he's just going to let the kill wash over him. [SPEAKER_02] He's a Tanner. He's just gonna let the kill wash open. I agree. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, right now let's go shoot on that. Yeah, I think he's a Tanner. I agree. I think we got to vote to the left [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_04] Thank you. [SPEAKER_04] I think Justin's a wear walk now. Yeah, Justin might be. I might be a wear- [SPEAKER_04] I could other option. [SPEAKER_02] That reaction makes me trust her. I don't think she's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] Let's uh, let's get to the next one. So is the fact that I'm not trustworthy? Like what am I doing that makes me no nephan? Yeah, it's just, and that's the very first. I've been pushing conversation to try to get this going. [SPEAKER_02] nothing. Yeah it's just... [SPEAKER_02] But you've done it before as a werewolf. And you played it. There's no one there's no one. [SPEAKER_01] There's no one there's no before this is just right now. I'm telling this this is all the information I have This is a game right now because we took out all the big things for the village We need to work together to deduce this. So what are you saying?

You're thinking of a strategy, right? [SPEAKER_01] or you just make sure the wear will. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I'm trying really hard to figure out your strategy. My strategy as a world for what? I'm waiting for you guys to see. I was either a hunter. [SPEAKER_02] I was either a hunter or a insomniac. I... [SPEAKER_01] I am one of those so I know which one you are if you're being truthful. I am being truthful. So now [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_03] So now, Justin. [SPEAKER_02] So, Laura's a wearable fortanta? So! [SPEAKER_03] That seems like a tantamount to draw the attention. Or a wearable... [SPEAKER_02] Or a wear-wolf move to try to draw the attention on me. Okay. By... It's a maze. It's a maze. It's a maze. So you're one of these, Mitchell? Yes. So we know who each other are. Yes. Great. [SPEAKER_03] Okay, bye. It's a nice, it's a booboo. So it's a booboo. So you're one of these? [SPEAKER_01] Yes, so we know who each other are. Yes great fist bump if you're you and I are both a truth [SPEAKER_02] Oh yeah, we both now... [SPEAKER_01] who we are. [SPEAKER_03] What the fuck are you saying you are? I wanted those two. [SPEAKER_02] What the fuck are you saying you are? I wanted those two. [SPEAKER_02] I'll run off until the end of the fucking Earth. [SPEAKER_03] That sounds like fucking next, yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, it does. Two where it does, but you know, Mitch and I always will respond with yes, it does. [SPEAKER_02] No, we're not wearables. We are these two roles. [SPEAKER_01] Her reaction makes me think she is a Tanner from O.S. [SPEAKER_03] Oh, it's gonna say makes me think that she's the werewolf because we took the maybe she's double the double me the heat off of her And if she is a werewolf James, but why I under us [SPEAKER_01] Because we took the whip... [SPEAKER_01] James, but why- I underestimated her. Right. [SPEAKER_02] I never cashed just when he was a whore. And if you hold his guess by me, so it would feel like just- I need to- [SPEAKER_03] I need to know if you're gonna fuck shit up. Please. Can you tell us what- [SPEAKER_02] Can you tell us one of the people you switched with by chance or one person you didn't like a feeling [SPEAKER_03] Like I feel like that's the problem too, because your story may change two or three times in the next two minutes. Is that such? [SPEAKER_00] because you're [SPEAKER_00] Because it's a trouble maker. I switched to Polymora. Well, okay. Snap. [SPEAKER_02] And. [SPEAKER_02] So [SPEAKER_03] So I'm one of those shitty people. [SPEAKER_02] So what were you originally Laura? [SPEAKER_02] Oh no. [SPEAKER_03] I hope you're low-key, secretly the Tanner, and you're just helping me out. Fuck me in the Tanner. You're like, I'm gonna play for Team Tanner. Highly suspect, James. Did not switch those two. I kinda think so too. [SPEAKER_03] I'm like 50, 50, and a G of James' is even telling anything truthful right now. Like based... Like, sorry, going back to past games, but like... There's such a... What? Chaotic variable. Are you standing by that? Yeah, so you were both for Paul? I got... [SPEAKER_04] Black communicate... [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] You're such a [SPEAKER_00] Are you standing by that? Yeah, so you were both for both? I got the troll maker garrows like I'm gonna make use of this. I fucking swaff the two coats of scarred astrumene of panic because cause so if we were to go knee and mental [SPEAKER_01] Because if we were to go near and meet up, this is who you would vote for. You want us to vote for Paul as well. [SPEAKER_00] uh... assuming the worst time of the truth yeah i would i would i would do that because why would she fucking if she calls where will for tenor why would you give past the tenor off to paul and get him killed [SPEAKER_01] How do you feel about that story? [SPEAKER_00] To me, I think we're just going to get full. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, they're much better. Let's get full. Everything, this is why I like lying as a villager because... [SPEAKER_03] by saying I was the next night away. But you still can be why I am in a... [SPEAKER_02] I was the nation right away. But you still can be blind. I mean, I know. I feel like there might be, but because it might be a general. [SPEAKER_01] But because it might be a Tanner on the board, I think just it might be a Tanner. [SPEAKER_02] Why do you think that? [SPEAKER_01] I want you to tell me which one of those I am. Yeah, I want you to do that too. I think that's it. [SPEAKER_02] I think this might be the same logic you're trying to put as me. It's possible. So how about we go into the table and give each other a little finger kiss? [SPEAKER_03] Bye bye. [SPEAKER_03] No, you should do that. There go. [SPEAKER_04] One minute remain. [SPEAKER_01] Lord, you swayed me with the werewolf. I am with the werewolf. He's lying. Justin's lying. Mitch's lying. [SPEAKER_00] Lord, you swayed me over the werewolf. [SPEAKER_02] He's alive. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] So he came to me first because he was trying to trap me. So I smoked things up a bit to get it on him. [SPEAKER_01] No, things up a bit to get it on him. Justin is blind, so I need the help from the villagers to add that up. Why? [SPEAKER_00] Why would you do it? No, you're gonna fuck me. Which one are you then? [SPEAKER_01] So which one are you then? I was the hunter. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] I don't know, you know what, full disclosure? [SPEAKER_01] I'm only 16 to 70% sure I was the hunter. [SPEAKER_02] I'm 100% sure I am 100 [SPEAKER_01] So I apologize in advance. [SPEAKER_00] I know, Jason Evans. No, you're not gonna find the story between offs that doesn't add up. I switched Paul and Laura. That's all I've done. I believe in James. If Laura was the werewolf, we gotta vote Paul. [SPEAKER_01] I'm holding that way. Because why the fuck... [SPEAKER_00] Why the fuck would she say yeah, let's fucking I think that [SPEAKER_01] I think that Justin's a tanner and he's trying to throw a wrench in it. I'm gonna vote for Justin. [SPEAKER_03] I'm gonna vote for Justin Because I think for me Justin is the biggest chance to be I'll vote for Paul, we got a gang call If I am, I'll vote for [SPEAKER_00] I think we got a game. We got a game. I'll vote for Paul. No. Kate. [SPEAKER_02] No, okay, whichever one of you has a better one for [SPEAKER_01] Okay."}

Alright. But okay, before Pogo's, would anyone like to play the troublemaker and say something? If not, then Paul, be my guest. [SPEAKER_00] more than anyone [SPEAKER_02] I'm gonna wait. I want to see where Paul's over there. [SPEAKER_01] I want to see what Paul's going to say. Okay, I am not going to claim my role right away. Listen, listen, number one, I didn't cheat accidentally this time. Number two, I am not going to claim my role. I'm not going to say my role until somebody claims my role. [SPEAKER_02] Let's see... [SPEAKER_00] No, so too, I am... [SPEAKER_00] they're both werewolves until somebody until some [SPEAKER_01] Alright. And then I will immediately at the point, at the point, at which point I will immediately call the none on that lie. I won't wait. [SPEAKER_02] and then I will immediately step in there. [SPEAKER_02] So we just talked for a minute. [SPEAKER_01] All right, so she's a hundred and she didn't know when it focused. She's a hunter. [SPEAKER_01] Okay Mason and I was alone. [SPEAKER_02] I was in Mason and I was alone. James, can we know why you were so adamant about wanting to trouble maker? Who do we... [SPEAKER_01] I haven't been in a fellow wanting to trouble. [SPEAKER_01] Who did we get? I was not the hunter or the Tanner Mitchell's line. I was amazing. That's what I was waiting for. There's two Mason. Yeah, but we would have seen each other. [SPEAKER_02] ??? [SPEAKER_01] No, I just can't do that. You actually almost would have had me there. You were way well. And you would even fucking see me. Because I literally was like... [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I was just fucking... [SPEAKER_02] What are you going with, Jordy? [SPEAKER_01] And as we went one second, it was me. So Mitchell tried to lie at the beginning. [SPEAKER_01] We'll kinda win. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, I thought you brought them yourself. So yeah, I'm suspicious Mitchell cuz I this is what I was this Mr. [SPEAKER_02] So yeah, I'm suspicious Mitchell cuz I this is what I was mismisterizing this time. I just leave as a villager and woke up as an alien. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] That seems legit. Alright. [SPEAKER_02] It's your Mason. I'm a Mason. I'm a troublemaker. Did you swap me with anyone? I'm just gonna swap you off. [SPEAKER_01] I just need a song, yeah, I did not wake up as myself. So I [SPEAKER_02] Yes. [SPEAKER_02] Can you confirm a story at the table? Yes. Which one? [SPEAKER_01] who baseball saw this book [SPEAKER_01] Yes. [SPEAKER_02] I want to hear it from you. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] but this one put you in the clear. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, but I want to put you in the clear. [SPEAKER_02] I mean, I've already, I said right out of the bat that I have in SWAT. [SPEAKER_01] And so you, and you verified that. Yes. So you've already verified. Yes, but I want you to verify your story. No, I've already verified mine to yours. See you. [SPEAKER_02] Even the knife. [SPEAKER_02] No charcoal pitching [SPEAKER_02] I verified that I said I- [SPEAKER_01] I want you to tell the sweet spot them with. [SPEAKER_02] Alright, I switched with you. He's amazing now. With him? Yeah, the Mitchell isn't lying. [SPEAKER_01] with him. [SPEAKER_02] And what the hell is that? But now I think it's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_00] But now I think [SPEAKER_02] If I was where if I would complete right now that I got swapped with him. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] What's an oral? [SPEAKER_02] Foot left. Kallora? Yeah. What? [SPEAKER_01] Can I kill the Hunter? She points at me! [SPEAKER_02] She points at me. Yeah, I have to figure out who's the real werewolf. No, I don't think there is a werewolf. No, I was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] No, I don't think there is a werewolf. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] Be careful just go first [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Who's your realest bitch, right? [SPEAKER_02] I switch YouTube. [SPEAKER_01] things Bible [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] I couldn't verify who you saw at me with. I didn't even know I got swapped. [SPEAKER_02] Now I do. [SPEAKER_01] Now I do. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] Now I am the Mason that I originally claimed to. Oh, that makes sense that you were the werewolf. Oh fuck, everything falls into place, mine's the werewolf, and you guys know it. You know what? [SPEAKER_02] we go forward. [SPEAKER_01] Go Paul. [SPEAKER_01] Voter left. [SPEAKER_02] 131 cos\u00ec 304 [SPEAKER_02] I'll go left. I'm gonna get the bone after you guys are. [SPEAKER_01] I was the insomniac and I woke up. [SPEAKER_01] I thought I could do that. Oh, I was the other werewolf. And you know what? I must have taken too long to go with Mitchell. So I guess it's 55 if you're too mid to me, Mitchell. Whichever one of us you want to kill. Because Mitchell is still a werewolf. [SPEAKER_02] No, I did switch much with you. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, and I was I was aware wolf to be Yeah, all the werewolves and you got us [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, all the way rules. You got us. We're going to your troublemaker, no one can verify that. Except for the fact that Mitch backed me into corner even though it was an obvious wear wolf tactic and I responded in an effort to help the villagers. Mom and Tanner, so I really don't give a shit. That's true. You are. [SPEAKER_00] and I responded in the effort. [SPEAKER_01] It's true. You are do you want to like what you want to kill me? I'll kill you after like I it won't count, but like I'll do it I'm like, I want to see what I'm doing. I'm not aware I was the where so we kill poll I was that's all I know is I what I started [SPEAKER_02] You wanna kill me? [SPEAKER_00] I'll tell you after like I [SPEAKER_02] I was the winner.

Molecoucch. [SPEAKER_03] Okay, so Jim is a dude isn't mine. Well, I love this. [SPEAKER_01] Well, this should go quickly. [SPEAKER_02] Um, James is the insomnia. Yeah. He was the one I looked at. Did you wake up? [SPEAKER_01] Did you wake up? I appreciate you looking at James as per the strategy. So if you were saucy or in your werewolf, I'd appreciate the light. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] why [SPEAKER_02] see this if we all vote left this time I will not be out for blood I won't 12 [SPEAKER_03] let's go boys [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] the latter. [SPEAKER_02] That's my proposal because I have no input no suspense. You're verified. You can confirm a story. Yeah. Yeah, I can confirm your story. My story. Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Because I have no input, no suspense. You're verified. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, yeah, thank you for your story. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] Queens? You pink m\u00e1s. [SPEAKER_01] You're out in the... I rug Justin. Oh, okay, that's cool. So who's you switch? [SPEAKER_01] because I switched you with somebody. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] But, here's the thing. Here's the thing. Are you wearable? No, because I promise I switched to with somebody. No, I was a villager. No, I'm not a hoarder. I'm a hoarder. So, all three of these are the best. The bagnails were saying. Yeah, that's crazy. Why are you so fat to vote that? That's why you were like, you were like, so before we show roles, if we want to vote that, let's do it. I'm like, because I'm bored with this role. I'm no intrigue. Oh, man. Okay. I got no shit to stir. So, what's up? Shit. So, no one has anything that I could say against Laura. I mean, she's probably a wear wolf. You did it when you did it when you were wearing a wear wolf. [SPEAKER_00] Here's the thing. Here's the thing. Paul, why are you wearable? No. [SPEAKER_00] No, I was a villager. I know, Charlie. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_00] Well, [SPEAKER_02] \ub458arin!! [SPEAKER_00] ceo [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_02] or like that. [SPEAKER_02] Bye. [SPEAKER_02] What I'm doing, too. [SPEAKER_02] So what? [SPEAKER_02] You can be in the air. Probably a werewolf. Let's do it. You did it when... [SPEAKER_00] I'm going back on Paths game. Yeah, you don't get on the village. I'm going Paths game. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, you don't have an ability to. I'm going past games, this is what I do. [SPEAKER_00] No, because I was so bummed that I was a villager, because when James fucked up, I was going to be a seer, and I was like, oh, stilt. [SPEAKER_01] Okay. [SPEAKER_02] Okay, okay. So who was the other person you switched to lower with? [SPEAKER_02] I think Paul's a dirty liar. [SPEAKER_00] If you're feeling you're aware of all of them. [SPEAKER_02] Although, if he was a dirty liar, he would have been like, why is so quick to vote left? [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] I am making a new liar. [SPEAKER_02] Okay, let's... [SPEAKER_01] on this turtle finishes making me karaoke together on screen my emoji [SPEAKER_02] My kids just pointed a bit away. I want you want to get I want to get them [SPEAKER_01] I want to get them birds. I'll get those right here. Oh, no, that's too low. Oh, yeah, just right there. [SPEAKER_02] Oh no that's too low. Oh yeah just right there's put right there okay um [SPEAKER_01] Too much, too much. [SPEAKER_02] I mean we have a boring thing, I confirm James, Mitch confirms me, Kay. [SPEAKER_01] Okay, I was thinking about lying about it just as soon as she says, but I'm gonna just say straight up who I switched. Should I switch you and I switched Justin? Okay. [SPEAKER_02] And that's 100% legit skater. Mitch did not confirm my story. He's a Tanner. I'm a werewolf. She's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_01] Sorry. [SPEAKER_02] You trying me? That's okay. [SPEAKER_01] What? You're aware of. So, Mitch's, Mitch's, I think, actually, take from his. [SPEAKER_02] So, Midge's... Midge's... I didn't actually take from his. I didn't actually take from his. I took from hers. I took from yours. [SPEAKER_02] I was so excited. Okay, that... [SPEAKER_01] Okay, that makes me believe you that he's Tanner. [SPEAKER_02] So if you did switch me with Laura Lord the World, if you didn't switch me, I am aware of what I should die. [SPEAKER_01] I did switch you most. I was being legit. [SPEAKER_02] And I'm also being legit. I was a werewolf. So no, I'm a werewolf. Yes, I'm sorry. It happens. James, I can't confirm if you were the insomniac. That's a me. Yeah, that's all that going with confirming my story. The witch I did not actually rob from him. I robbed from you. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I'm not all that going with... [SPEAKER_01] to which I didn't [SPEAKER_01] I know so if you're the tenor why was that your strategy is because no he's telling you because [SPEAKER_02] He's no he's telling you because he wants you to try to win as the Tanner. That's what he wants right now Now he's he's just sitting here on the Tanner. Oh, I didn't even like pick that up you No, I was the lover I was the robber. So you are not yeah, I'm not the Tanner I'm trying to make you think you are deep down in his soul [SPEAKER_01] Oh, I didn't even like that. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I was a lover. [SPEAKER_01] So [SPEAKER_01] Don't, please try to- [SPEAKER_01] But there's no situation where I'm the Tanner. [SPEAKER_01] I'm the trouble maker. I'm the only person who could make someone else. Can Justin be the Tanner? Is that a [SPEAKER_00] I'm the tro- [SPEAKER_02] Can Justin be the Tanner? Is that a possibility? I don't care. No. [SPEAKER_00] No, because wait, no. No, because that wasn't going to hurt the door. No, because that wasn't going to hurt the door. [SPEAKER_02] Because that wasn't going to hurt him for Laura. I want everyone to vote for Laura. [SPEAKER_01] That means you're being, and you're just talking three different beliefs that you rob from your tanner. [SPEAKER_02] I think we kill Laura. [SPEAKER_02] Oh, good. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] E konu\u015fiert dich zur Delay?- [SPEAKER_00] What do you have in your hands? [SPEAKER_00] Well, I was a villager to start with, but if someone traded me, you said you switched weight. You switched eyes. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Now he's saying that he was aware of the start. [SPEAKER_00] I believe Justin. [SPEAKER_01] I believe Justin. Yeah, I do too. Well, here's the thing. Regardless of what Mitchell is. We gotta vote. If we don't, we gotta lower it up. Yeah, I wouldn't have said it. [SPEAKER_02] I do too. What? [SPEAKER_00] Here's the thing, we're got this...

[SPEAKER_01] I saw two from the middle. Nice! [SPEAKER_01] I don't think my stats is from the middle. [SPEAKER_00] I think Mitch saw me and he knows I'm gonna hold. [SPEAKER_02] I think mention Justin or werewolves. I think my second- [SPEAKER_01] I think my second now you guys are gonna turn against me for no reason. I already... I already... [SPEAKER_00] I already partially turned to be honest just because the way you said I'm turning up. [SPEAKER_01] Turned off, nice. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] I'm not gonna say oh one of the two you said I want to know I want to be in your own team because right now I'm gonna well fuck is happening here and I just want to know I believe you're the seer that I'm like [SPEAKER_00] I want to know who you are. [SPEAKER_02] I want to be sure of your M18. [SPEAKER_02] What the fuck is happening here? [SPEAKER_00] I don't know if I can look at this guy. [SPEAKER_02] But it's also vice versa as well. Because one of these guys is lying. [SPEAKER_01] It's also vice versa as well. [SPEAKER_00] I'll see you [SPEAKER_01] I'll say one thing I saw one werewolf in the middle so we know there's not just one werewolves. [SPEAKER_02] is not just put on where your walls. There could be no. [SPEAKER_01] I'm is possible. I did not see two werewolves in the middle either way so I would have said what you [SPEAKER_02] What do you see otherwise? What else was there? I'll leave that for a certain time at least [SPEAKER_01] I'll leave that for a certain time, at least. [SPEAKER_02] Keep thrilling! [SPEAKER_01] He's a Tanner. You see a Tanner? Okay, so he did not see a Tanner. He did the trouble maker. This is... [SPEAKER_00] Did you see a Tanner? He did not see a Tanner. You're the trouble maker. This is exciting. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, that's why I would work. Well, I mean how would you? Can I ask if you switched me? Because then switched me, because I woke up as me. [SPEAKER_00] Can I ask if you switched me because [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] But how would you wear it? That's fucking impossible. Because I switched you two. Nice. So you're not in insomnia. I'm in insomnia. I keep woke up as a Tanner. James is the werewolf. Right. Case closed. But you didn't say you woke up as the insomnia. I don't know, but he looked and he saw Tanner so he's trying to get himself killed. Oh, I see. James, we have the other werewolf in it. So we got to go for James. Because I was the Tanner. I believe it. No, that was. Wait, no. Can you take it? These two are going to start back pedaling. Because we have them in the corner. Here we go. [SPEAKER_01] But how would you hurt... [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] So, I'm gonna keep rollin' up as a Tanner. [SPEAKER_02] I don't know, but he looks... [SPEAKER_01] so we gotta go [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Wait, no, can you... [SPEAKER_01] So you used to do stuff. You know the Tanner? Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] So you switched off the... You knew the Tanner? Yeah. And you know that because you woke up as the Tanner. [SPEAKER_02] And you know that because you will come up as the standard. [SPEAKER_00] If you would know that. Would you worry because if he was being a zombie, he gets to look. [SPEAKER_01] You would, because if he was being a zombie, he gets to look. But Laura, why were you so curious what I saw because you didn't get to see any cards during the night? So you wouldn't be able to verify my story or not. [SPEAKER_00] I wanted to know if I can get where I was at. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] I wanted to know because if you like a lot of things, trouble maker. Because otherwise I would be like, that would make sense. That would make sense. So James is a confident werewolf right now. He's the wolf of Wall Street. The werewolf of Wall Street. I thought he's the down here. You're the Tanner. So I'm the Tanner. You're the Tanner. So we kill James. [SPEAKER_01] because if you lie to each other [SPEAKER_02] make a ko otheri [SPEAKER_02] Where would he use the wall strip? [SPEAKER_02] If you guys come, you're gonna make a mistake because I am just a low-leaner buddy. I just say your Tanner. Because I just want to get Justin killed as the Tanner. [SPEAKER_02] I approve. [SPEAKER_01] James, I saw this one in the middle. [SPEAKER_02] So Mitch is fucking lying on his ass off right now. Mitch is a dirty werewolf. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] You [SPEAKER_00] Are you guys are confused about this? [SPEAKER_01] Thank you. Bye! [SPEAKER_01] It's okay to be honest. No, I actually did not see a village in the morning or in the morning. At night, I saw a robber. I was just trying to see how James would react from that. One minute remaining. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Hey. [SPEAKER_02] One minute. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, so we just for sure don't kill Paul. We can't kill Paul here. Let's come at you. [SPEAKER_02] That's come match. So it's either James that's come match. That's come match. [SPEAKER_00] Let's go man. [SPEAKER_00] I don't think it's Mitchell. Oh, but you said you woke up as the insomniac. He's lying. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, because he switched. Yeah, he's a Tanner. He's trying to get himself killed. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] because you swim. [SPEAKER_02] Um, excuse me. Jeez, I don't know if this- [SPEAKER_01] I don't know if this helps me but why would I say I woke up as the insomniac if I was the [SPEAKER_02] So we could never night. Are we gonna ask me to read? [SPEAKER_00] It will work out. [SPEAKER_00] Decrease, especially. Yeah, just like you know, is your original... [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, just like you know is your original story? Why? You're a channel. Why? Why? If you were a villager, why would you do that? Every 15 seconds. I'm pointing at James. I'm pointing at James. I'm pointing at James. Hey, just so you know. That's where it is not. [SPEAKER_00] We are down to town or? Oh you hew [SPEAKER_00] I'm pointing at you. [SPEAKER_00] We can now capture everything. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] I think 100% James is not a werewolf. I think he is. I think he's a tenor. Yeah, I think he's a tenor. No, James is no telling me so. [SPEAKER_00] That's it. [SPEAKER_00] No, yeah, I think he's the turner. No, James is no telling me something"}

I'm pretty confident that I'm not aware wolf because only a robber could take for me and a robber's not aware wolf. So I don't know where wolf's not gonna give you a lot of information right away. I'm a trouble maker. I love that logic by the way. I did the same thing that I did last time. I switched you to. [SPEAKER_01] I'm a troublemaker, I love that logic. [SPEAKER_02] I'm an insomniac, but at the very least I could verify whether he did or did not switch me. [SPEAKER_01] I said it was my turn. I'm just, I'm worried that she might have been a werewolf because, you know. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] I'll turn you in back. [SPEAKER_01] I'm gonna pick all of them. Nice. Nice and safe. No, it happened again. I was the Tanner. [SPEAKER_01] Wait, if you're a... Tanner, you're the Tanner now, so you want to die. [SPEAKER_03] or you're the Tanner now. [SPEAKER_01] But we're not gonna fall over that bullshit. Oh, hey. [SPEAKER_02] That balls it. Were you a world? [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, the Canadian money is called a boon, and we also have a tuning. [SPEAKER_00] No, like all Canadian money. Yeah, but you're just like a loo [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] You're like, Alunia to get your paper, Alunia, paper, Alunia. My 50-Lunia Denailment. [SPEAKER_01] James, can we hear what you work? [SPEAKER_00] James, can we hear what you are? It costs 50. Like it's a game and it's just like a nut. Are you the hunter? Is that why you're so confident? [SPEAKER_01] Are you the hunter? Is that why you're so confident right now? [SPEAKER_00] Someone villageer. [SPEAKER_02] Mirror [SPEAKER_01] Yeah! Oh, and we need to hear from you too. Well, I can confirm who it matches the story because if you woke up, you woke up as that. [SPEAKER_00] Here's the thing, if you were a werewolf, you're now the Tanner. So, you know, my werewolf is in your- [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] But you know where we're all busy. [SPEAKER_01] her both ways. No, because then though, you're the werewolf. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] No, I got switched. [SPEAKER_02] Now you started as the one that was in the dust and our werewolf. You started as the werewolf. [SPEAKER_02] Why are you in the Tanner? [SPEAKER_01] You're the Tanner! No, I'm... What did you rob? [SPEAKER_02] I wasn't the raw resin sun yet and would you wake up as the insomnia you [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Okay, that would also make sense. So is either Paul's lying or is he a vlogger? Paul's lying. [SPEAKER_01] Hotline, hotline, they're fucking so... [SPEAKER_00] Subway! [SPEAKER_00] Paul is lying about shooting. Yeah, but I stole his information. Oh, I'm a doll. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, but I stole... [SPEAKER_01] Go for the donation, the donation. [SPEAKER_02] I don't need to rob her, so if he woke up... [SPEAKER_01] and saw on the act. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_00] That is what happened. So. But now we don't fucking know anything about them because you outed my life. I am. [SPEAKER_03] But now we don't fucking [SPEAKER_01] I'm a fucking Tanner like and now you guys can't vote for me. Have we heard what she is? No [SPEAKER_00] No, it's been so long since we were making up on that. Okay, let's go. I kind of think best option is to vote Laura. And not a weird one. Where are you? Yeah, just take a look. [SPEAKER_01] To wash hands and before restosexuality is\ufffd\ufffd\uba74es when blood is removed feared [SPEAKER_03] This is my new February win. [SPEAKER_01] I think best [SPEAKER_01] Oh fuck! Uh, I'll give you a donation. You do, yeah. Thanks outside of this a little bit if that's okay. Just so we don't waste time of the game. Not that you're donating. What you waste of time. I'm gonna just pause it. I'm just pause it. I can't back that up. I don't know if it's supposed to be. So no talking we're paused. Yeah, what up, yo? Thank you so much for your donation. It helps us get to our goal hammer's quicker and it means the world to us. We'll get you that mug. We'll sign it. We'll not the mug. We'll sign the box. So much. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_00] I'm gonna just pause, I'm just pause while that is. Like I can't back panel. I'm gonna pause while that is. So no talking we're paused. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] I'm gonna... [SPEAKER_02] citrullc [SPEAKER_01] and it just means a lot of us. So now we'll go back to the game, what up yo? What up yo? Thank you so much. [SPEAKER_01] Who's saying you're the hunter? [SPEAKER_00] Oh, stay singer! [SPEAKER_03] 100? [SPEAKER_01] Can you do me a favor if we can do, can you? Can you? Yeah, a couple things. [SPEAKER_00] We're the ones who spank in, Kankin. Yeah, a couple things. First of all, I can't believe somebody bought a mug after that mug plug, so like mega things. And number two, James, I don't think is a closet homeowner. Not that it would be bad if he was. Do you have a problem? Yeah, there's no problem. [SPEAKER_01] mega thing [SPEAKER_01] There's no problem with, we'll know who is he. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Let's keep going. Yeah, we'll just let our mod to deal with that. It's really easy. Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Clickidor [SPEAKER_00] It's pretty easy to see this, the cool things are going to do. So I think, yeah, best bet is to vote her. Yeah. [SPEAKER_03] I see some kind of scenery Outside of snapshots [SPEAKER_03] So I think yeah. [SPEAKER_01] But who would you vote for? Who would you vote for? Laura. If you were the...

[SPEAKER_00] I didn't see you guys, but I know that video. [SPEAKER_02] I think either she's a hunter or a werewolf. She's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_00] You guys want to hold on to me, ask. [SPEAKER_01] but no, then she doesn't actually doesn't kill. [SPEAKER_01] Well, I want you guys to kill me. Yeah, I know. The dogs are out of hitty boat for the Tanner.

Oh my god, I'm gonna go for it. [SPEAKER_01] you [SPEAKER_01] Just to see if I got to find who she's going to vote for. Yeah. Kill him. And then. [SPEAKER_02] And I think she's in a position where she doesn't know who to vote for because there is no way wall. [SPEAKER_02] That's my gut. [SPEAKER_01] That's my gut. [SPEAKER_01] Killed Justin anyways. Yeah sure, just kill me. He'll wait if he's the dad, don't. But just, we ought to do the book. Once I get through these meetings. It's all over. It's all over.

[SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02] You will have to be aware of it, didn't you? No. [SPEAKER_01] Yes, that's why who did you get? [SPEAKER_00] If I got switched I wouldn't know I just will have something [SPEAKER_01] of what? [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] pull [SPEAKER_00] Somebody here's the thing someone will be able to confirm my story of what I woke up as and now that it was nowhere Well, okay, I'll get I'll get up [SPEAKER_02] Somebody, here's the thing. [SPEAKER_02] I'll get the ball rolling. I can confirm Paul's story. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, I'm one of these two. [SPEAKER_00] And now I'm- [SPEAKER_00] Here you go. [SPEAKER_02] So she has trouble making where we'll have robber and seer. [SPEAKER_02] Okay, how do we make progress? [SPEAKER_01] Okay, how do we make progress? We're going to make progress. [SPEAKER_00] We're gonna say you prove that you're the trouble maker and model of who did you switch? This is how you prove it so This is very true. Think about your life carefully [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, this is very true. [SPEAKER_00] I think... [SPEAKER_01] Not too much. Right. No time. Three, two, one. Switched us to you. Fuck. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, it's like the same. Yeah, that's, it was pretty good. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, well then I'm the dadder. It's gone rich. I think you're the one who'll... [SPEAKER_02] I can agree with that. I disagree. [SPEAKER_03] I don't trust Paul. I also don't trust Robert here. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_00] . . [SPEAKER_00] He's not the actual robber here. He's a zero robber. He's totally well. He go in that order. What is this? [SPEAKER_03] Oh [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Justin if you were this year, I'm just gonna fucking assume no you're the robber you fuck you're the robber [SPEAKER_02] Why would you fuck? Who did you obviously stole from Paul? Yeah. He is the insomniac. He woke up as the robber. Did you wake up as the robber? Yep. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] the insomniac or the wolf wear wolves. I think Laura is the wear wolf, but I'm also on that. [SPEAKER_02] I think Laura is the werewolf of the Irish Star Entross. [SPEAKER_01] I'm also on that page as well. Here's the thing yeah cuz it [SPEAKER_00] Here's the thing yeah because if we were both wearables, we'd have no idea what's here Yeah, so first of both claim these roles assuming this [SPEAKER_01] So first of both [SPEAKER_01] That's a real real careful here. This seems like a like yeah [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, that's... [SPEAKER_00] That's what I'm just saying. I just want... [SPEAKER_01] I just want to just want to rule it out. I'm not... I mean, rule it out for you. [SPEAKER_00] Let me roll it out for you. If we were both wear wolves, we wouldn't know what was in the center So for both of us to confirm that we're the insomnia I can say the insomnia I want to catch us in a live about that [SPEAKER_02] You said the insomniate went to Ke- [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, he said he saw the actor for anyone else said anything. Yeah [SPEAKER_03] But at the same time. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, we go. I don't know. [SPEAKER_00] I don't know at the same time. If Laura switch. [SPEAKER_03] If Laura switched us and they're both werewolves, these two could be in the middle and we could be like that could be the sound with not that [SPEAKER_00] It could be the sound. It's not that. It would be so risky. It would be really... [SPEAKER_01] But fuck, there's only 40 seconds left. I like the idea that he said he was in sawmeack right away Yeah, I don't trust his I think it's either Laura Laura unless I'm not the hunter in the market truly is the total maker. I'm taking a lot [SPEAKER_03] There's all yours had. [SPEAKER_03] I don't trust his talk at all. [SPEAKER_00] I think yes. [SPEAKER_02] I think Laura is the werewolf. I'm gonna be taking... [SPEAKER_02] I'm taking a lot. I'm taking a lot more. Take it out. So if you switch me and Mitch on, it's doing it. [SPEAKER_00] So if you switch me and the Chinese story, if I get voted out there's not a thing. [SPEAKER_01] service [SPEAKER_02] Tell me that's your butt, James, right? Okay, good. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_03] What? No. [SPEAKER_01] Are you actually touting it corpo? [SPEAKER_01] and you switch to James now. [SPEAKER_03] So you can't take anybody out. Cause yeah, all right, we killed it. [SPEAKER_02] Alright, we kill Mitchell, he points at Laura. No, no, no, no. He's better. He's better. No, we kill Laura. We kill Laura. No, no, no, no. You're killing. No, let's do that. [SPEAKER_03] Thank you very much. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] inhas [SPEAKER_03] can [SPEAKER_03] Oh! [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_02] Laura, what are you doing, Laura?

[SPEAKER_01] when it comes to the rubber, I was the rubber. Oh, you switched after me though. [SPEAKER_03] So I had switched with Paul, then you switched these two. Yep. Mmm. [SPEAKER_02] So we what what what was the order yeah, then one more time do the one more time show which me and [SPEAKER_03] You switched me and Mike? No, no, no, I stole from you. You stole from me then you swapped. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] No. Yeah, he swapped. I swapped you two and Paul was the werewolf [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] So you're the one. So you're the one who... Yeah. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] Okay, yeah, you can firm those I don't fucking know what [SPEAKER_02] Thank you. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, post. So he's gonna break it down. Whatever you were, he stole from you, whatever the fuck you were. Okay. And then I swapped you and Eric. [SPEAKER_01] So here you go, break it down. Whatever you... [SPEAKER_01] Leia [SPEAKER_01] And I was the hunter and I'm still the hunter because I'm looking for my kill. So... [SPEAKER_02] So whatever you were is now sitting on my double mic. [SPEAKER_02] He was the werewolf, he was... [SPEAKER_03] I was the towner. I was the towner. Fuck. Okay. [SPEAKER_02] I started as Tanner so he's a Tanner now that's why he's saying [SPEAKER_03] ... Far away! [SPEAKER_03] So the both were moves are in the center. Oh, that's what he did. Yeah, that's what he did. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, that's why you put wear-wolden thing right away. [SPEAKER_01] so we [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_02] You're the okay, I think you're the Tanner I believe I [SPEAKER_01] I believe you're still worried that you might be the where- [SPEAKER_03] I think you're still worried that you might be the where one. I don't know why he would be worried about that. I think that as well. See what it is. [SPEAKER_01] I think that as well. See what it is so counter. [SPEAKER_02] .. e what the stuff account to [SPEAKER_02] So how do we do it without him fucking up the boat by voting to the right? Why he it wouldn't benefit him. He'd lose. He would still lose. Yeah. But I can make it village loose. OK, but so no one can convert Justin's story though. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah. [SPEAKER_03] and [SPEAKER_01] No, but if they vote for me, then vote for me. A fucking kill whoever does it. Could it be a word? [SPEAKER_02] You'll point it to me a werewolf. Yeah, before we just let that yeah, you could have seen the hunter in the middle Are you lying about being a trouble man? I know. So I'm pretty sure I'm pretty sure Yeah, no one's pretty sure this is legit, but Paul does mention there's a possibility Justin was a werewolf and so I'll pay about her Babe, because literally what's happening right now [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, you could have seen the Hunter in the middle. Are you lying about being a trouble maker? I know, I'm so. I'm pretty sure this is legit. Yeah, thanks so much. I'm pretty sure this is legit. [SPEAKER_03] well I'm going to gr\u8a8d\u70ba well [SPEAKER_03] both werewolves are in the middle. Yeah, as is the seer who could really help it. It can happen though, like we can't... [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, as is the... [SPEAKER_01] It can happen though, like we can't say that that's some sort of anomaly right it's very likely to happen just in case they're going to I know but that would just be [SPEAKER_02] I know but that would just be really that worked out really well for you if you are Where will what did he say is your old? It was right away right away, but someone I wear off who sees under the middle would do it right away [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_03] the heat stays rolled. It was right away. Right away. [SPEAKER_03] Well, actually, as a safety effect, then, why don't we all vote for you? I have no one to kill. Vote left. [SPEAKER_02] I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. I'm going to start with the first one. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_01] I have no one to kill. [SPEAKER_01] No, because I'll kill you and we'll lose. Why would we lose? Because the villagers would die. [SPEAKER_02] The only way for the villagers to win if there's no wearables is if we all vote for if everyone gets one vote. So it's a tie between everybody. [SPEAKER_01] if there's no wearables. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_01] Okay. [SPEAKER_01] Don't you have to be worried? Yeah, I might. [SPEAKER_02] And yeah, he's it nobody he's a tenor so he wouldn't fuck it up a tenor would well he could either way He loses either Tenor make us all lose He's still a win, but he could but the question is are we No work or could Justin be a world yeah [SPEAKER_01] Well, he fit it either way. [SPEAKER_00] I'm losing either way. You can just... You can't... [SPEAKER_01] He gets down the way. [SPEAKER_03] But I'm not. He's still a wind but he could be. [SPEAKER_00] For the questions. [SPEAKER_01] Are we sure we're the where we're going? [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, I am the hunter. [SPEAKER_03]  [SPEAKER_03] If you're not, you're playing a very smart game. Just as the werewolf. [SPEAKER_02] What card did you look at because there wasn't one remaining? [SPEAKER_00] The water-related remains. [SPEAKER_01] Remaining. Oh, what if I was the where I ain't never stole from anybody [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_03] I'll stay the rest of it. No, no, no, no. You moved from the whole time, beginning. You moved from the whole time, beginning. So what did you see in high-end fucking looks? I was the more over-the-hand. Here's the Tanner. Oh right, yeah, okay, then we're good. You're right. Because otherwise you would give us that info. There's no reason for you not to. Yeah. Yeah. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] Here's the Tanner. Oh right. Yeah, okay then. You're right. [SPEAKER_02] Okay, vote to the left. [SPEAKER_03] Yep. Yep. It's up to Mike what happened. So yeah. [SPEAKER_02] It's up to Mike what happened. Yeah. And there's a gamble in Justin's. I am a hunter.

[SPEAKER_01] so switch these right here. [SPEAKER_01] So we're off. Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] So the person you switch with would be a wear wolf. Mm-hmm. And is that person going to come forward? [SPEAKER_00] So the person needs to switch. [SPEAKER_01] It wasn't me, right? [SPEAKER_01] Right? Right? Well, you just added yourself didn't you? No, I didn't. What you doing? [SPEAKER_01] So you might you can confirm me. I can't. So is the person who I switched with who thinks that he's a werewolf going to be open? Why do I think Justin's like? Because I switched them. So Justin started the Insolveniac and he's saying the Insolveniac. Oh, OK. Then he's lying. Because anybody else would know if you have any things on your side. I do have information, but I'm going to save it. Why? Share it now. We need it now. No, dude, we need it now. It's three minutes. No. It's four minutes. We're running out of time. Four minutes left. [SPEAKER_00] So is the person like [SPEAKER_00] Oh, he's taking some here? [SPEAKER_00] because anybody else would know if they had any wrongs on their side. I do. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_01] I was very well used. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I was I did not switch you in Justin. I switched Mitch and Justin. No, which means doesn't are all Then why is Mitch not admitting what he was. Oh, I know that's me yet. Which one are you? I was a hunter. I can confirm that story. I'm a hunter when I woke up [SPEAKER_00] I [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] then why is mission opening? [SPEAKER_00] Oh, no one's asking you. Which one are you? [SPEAKER_01] Good afternoon. grenades so many. Oh, a bat so many story time I guess. Oh, big stopping now. [SPEAKER_00] pasuntingreyby off they get the pls again and and again and eventually the peak because you people might just let you know I agree that's began with my madam pint [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, and now I'm not. I'm not in there. Basically, what? Like, did you look in the center? I did. OK, so we're all voting for you then. Why would you? [SPEAKER_00] Basically, what? Did you look in the... [SPEAKER_00] So we're all voting for you that I think. Why would you lie at the beginning just in the front? We got a werewolf vote. Yeah, I mean, yeah. No, and it works. [SPEAKER_01] We got a werewolf boat. Yeah, I mean yeah, and it worked it actually it did save us so I'm using them This is that and let's use the Tanner because he just come out. I think it's the best boat It is the best, yeah, but Mike. What did you just saw those two? I saw these two. I'm willing to kill Paul just for no We can confirm Yeah, I think it's you So if this one is was so short will play one more is there any other possibility? We don't have a tank up with there's a Tanner It could eat there yet, but that's the only risk in a thought a big risk. Let's not a big risk It's a 50 50 chance that he's totally the Tanner Paul doesn't just [SPEAKER_00] So I'm guessing that this is... [SPEAKER_00] I think it's the best boat. It is the best, yo. [SPEAKER_00] I saw these too. [SPEAKER_00] So we can confirm that there could be. [SPEAKER_00] This one is [SPEAKER_00] But that's the only risk in the- [SPEAKER_00] What? [SPEAKER_01] Say the truth the first time and we learned about anything he's done. No, but he thought he got switched with somebody. I'll call it no. He's a Tanner. Then here's what you do. You killed me. I'll point a poll. I'm gonna lose regardless. Yes. No, no, no, if you die, if I'm a Tanner, I'll lose. But I want to use the hunter ability. They want you to join in. [SPEAKER_00] Nobody utising.. [SPEAKER_00] on the Lizzy redo evil\uc5b4\uce71 [SPEAKER_00] No, no, we, if you die, if I'm in Canada, I'll fill in. But I want... [SPEAKER_00] I'm quite convinced he is. I'm gonna show this what we missed. I'm quite convinced he's cool. I'll take the chance. [SPEAKER_01] I'm gonna show this what we missed and try to make it possible. I'll take the chances of the channer because if we do the whole vote to the left thing which we were gonna do He just votes the opposite direction. We still lose But at least the werewolf any votes to the left he wins exactly. So I'll say that if I'm the Tanner I will vote with the village. I'm not that kind of Tanner [SPEAKER_00] Wait here [SPEAKER_00] I'll- [SPEAKER_01] Right. I didn't know we're keeping school. Okay, let's aim at the where we'll... [SPEAKER_00] Okay, let's aim at the where we'll... [SPEAKER_01] I want to know what Mitch wants to do because I'm with him. I think he's a Tanner and I think [SPEAKER_00] Is that right? Is that right? [SPEAKER_00] And I think we should vote to the left, date Mitchell. [SPEAKER_01] I think we should more likely he's more likely chances that we vote him out we win. I agree with that.

I don't believe. [SPEAKER_01] And less eyes which is [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Well, I'm sorry to say, Mature, I switched you with somebody. Yeah, but... [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00]  [SPEAKER_00] Why do you, why are you coming out as the tenor? [SPEAKER_01] You lose, remember? Yeah. Oh, shit. [SPEAKER_01] I think you're playing so confused I think you're playing that hard play You started this year? Okay, yeah [SPEAKER_00] I think you're looking so confused. I think you're playing that hard part. You started the seer? Okay, yeah. What if I say this? I switched you with Mitch. Were you still the Tanner? [SPEAKER_01] Melody through this like fake ass. No, no I am 100% ice. [SPEAKER_00] No, no I am 100% I switched you and Mitch. No, I don't think you get it. [SPEAKER_00] I 100% bit. No. I 100% did. I'm 100% I'm the hunter. Because when the trouble maker came up and you said don't switch my card I switched your fucking card because he said it. No. [SPEAKER_01] 100% of you. Okay. 100%. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_00] Give your story then, because I did switch it. Who did you switch him a match, sir? Is there wood last night? No. So nobody had- Did you have wood last night? There wasn't a morning. I was like, what? [SPEAKER_01] Hopefully, did you have wood? Like, there wasn't a morning. [SPEAKER_01]  [SPEAKER_01] I 100% finished it. Just what the fuck were you actually? You were the seer. No, you were the seer. And you were the seer. And you were the Tanner. Neat. Check so. I don't care about these two worlds. I think today it's two. OK. On the Tanner, we got two seers. [SPEAKER_00] I 100% finished shooting. Just what the fuck were you actually? You were where I was the serial? No, you were the serial. Okay. [SPEAKER_00] Check so I don't care [SPEAKER_01] and a hunter, I say vote to them. [SPEAKER_00] Well, check it out. Can nobody look at Mitchell's card, right? Right, it might be a werewolf and I just don't know. I think Justin and Mitchell are actually our werewolves. Look at that. [SPEAKER_01] by [SPEAKER_01] That was, don't mind me upset. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, keep it then you switch lines from maybe there again Justin or werewolves. Shibon! [SPEAKER_01] So maybe there again. [SPEAKER_00] No, it's an OV.

I say we believe both of these two are as seer. [SPEAKER_02]  [SPEAKER_00] When you were that way I said [SPEAKER_00] I got the same time. Well, no, Justin's been really defending it. I think we need to vote for Justin. I don't. Justin's not only running confident, but there's too much luck with his washing-ass. Yeah, what did you see? If you were to see her, you haven't really- I liked her too in the center. What did you see? Did you look too much under? No, we saw the insomniac left. [SPEAKER_01] I don't... Justin's not here.

Second left. So who's staring at me? I saw him as the Tanner. [SPEAKER_01] 20 seconds left. So we can't go there. He's not the time. He's not the 10 anymore. He's just a moat. And Mitch, what were you? You were the hunter? [SPEAKER_00] He's not the time. Yeah, he's not the 10 anymore. I just don't know. [SPEAKER_01] as we're all. [SPEAKER_01] So vote Eric.
