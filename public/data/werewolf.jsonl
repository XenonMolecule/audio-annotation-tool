Werewolves, wake up and look for other werewolves. If there is only one werewolf, you may look at a card from the center. [SPEAKER_B]: Is this disco Halloween? [SPEAKER_A]: Werewolves, close your eyes. Seer, wake up. You may look at another player's card or two of the center cards. Seer, close your eyes. Robber, wake up. You may exchange your card with another player's card and then view your new card. Robber, close your eyes. Troublemaker, wake up. You may exchange cards between two other players. Troublemaker, close your eyes. Insomniac, wake up and look at your card. Insomniac, close your eyes. Everyone, keep your eyes closed and reach out and move your card around slightly. [SPEAKER_C]: Man. [SPEAKER_D]: Did anyone else feel like they were. [SPEAKER_C]: Falling when their eyes were closed? [SPEAKER_B]: No. [SPEAKER_D]: Wake up. [SPEAKER_B]: Do we ever. [SPEAKER_E]: No, but that does have. That happened to me once here. [SPEAKER_B]: Does he. Do we ever figure out why? He says, like one night fever. [SPEAKER_C]: Just Easter eggs. All right, so these are the tokens we can use to represent people. So Paul's saying he was. [SPEAKER_B]: I was a villager. [SPEAKER_E]: I have no information. I was the insomniac. [SPEAKER_D]: I was also a villager. [SPEAKER_E]: I can hear you move quite a bit during the night. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, well, that's because I was dancing. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, Yeah. I tend to move the whole time. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, yeah, I some. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm erratic. [SPEAKER_C]: So James and I. What did you. Did you wake. We'll wait to see what James and I say. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, I can tell you, Mitch, if. [SPEAKER_E]: You want to talk now, you go ahead. [SPEAKER_B]: Last I saw, that was the situation. [SPEAKER_C]: So you were the robber? [SPEAKER_B]: I was. [SPEAKER_C]: And you stole from him? [SPEAKER_B]: I did. And I was disappointed. I was like, fuck witness protection. [SPEAKER_C]: Alright, well, I can convince. I can confirm James story that he was the robbery. [SPEAKER_B]: All right. [SPEAKER_E]: I woke up as myself. [SPEAKER_B]: Boring. [SPEAKER_C]: Boring. Is this really. [SPEAKER_B]: Is this real life? Mitch is a fuzzy wuzzy. [SPEAKER_D]: This is a fuzzy wuzzy. [SPEAKER_E]: Here's what could happen. I could be a werewolf because I have no alibi. He also could be. I could be. Who else could be? [SPEAKER_C]: James and I could both be werewolves. [SPEAKER_E]: Technically, I could also be werewolves. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, basically. [SPEAKER_E]: Is there anyone who has. I'm the only one who's definitely villager. Oh, yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, I can convince. I know Paul's telling the truth. Cause I stole his card. And I believe. [SPEAKER_D]: And I believe James story because you saw Paul's card. [SPEAKER_C]: I saw your card. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, I shouldn't have given it as a villager. [SPEAKER_C]: No, as a seer. I saw you as the robber. Oh, yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Gotcha. Gotcha. Hmm. [SPEAKER_E]: We've got a pickle. [SPEAKER_D]: No. Someone else won. [SPEAKER_C]: I Think it was David or whatever. I'm not sure if his name was talking about. [SPEAKER_E]: I have some suspicions about Mitchell because he gave away that he was the insomniac so fast. I think he might have seen the insomniac. [SPEAKER_D]: I feel like maybe. Or he is saying that because he. [SPEAKER_C]: Was the insomniac and he woke up the insomniac. So he's essentially a vill. Because an insomniac who doesn't change just basically nothing. They know nothing. They just know by themselves. [SPEAKER_D]: Right. [SPEAKER_E]: But I'm saying if he was a werewolf and saw the insomniac in the. [SPEAKER_D]: Middle, that would be a really. [SPEAKER_C]: It would be a safe thing. [SPEAKER_E]: That's exactly why it would be a good. [SPEAKER_B]: So this is what we're saying right now. No troublemaker shifted us up. Right. That's what we're saying right now. [SPEAKER_E]: I feel like if somebody was the troublemaker, they would have mentioned to try. [SPEAKER_D]: To get some chaos or if anything. [SPEAKER_E]: Else, they would have. Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm just gonna. I'm gonna hedge my bets on Mitch lying, I think. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I kind of think Mitch is. I have. This makes me think. No, because what if me and Justin are both werewolves? [SPEAKER_C]: Also a possibility. [SPEAKER_E]: But it's not. There's no way that they're both werewolves because for them to both lie about what they were, not knowing that none of us were, that would have been too risky because Mitch copped to being the insomniac before. [SPEAKER_B]: Does the seer see before the robber robbed? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: It goes catching a lie. [SPEAKER_C]: It goes werewolf, seer, robber, troublemaker, and sonic. There's the numbers on it. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, yeah. Fair enough. Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: I also don't think Laura is the werewolf because I don't think in her first game she would go for a villager lie as a werewolf. Yeah, that's a bit of meta working. [SPEAKER_D]: But I'd be so pissed if I was a werewolf because I was Hitler last time. So much. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, I think. What. [SPEAKER_E]: What is happening. There's ways to get points. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you pronounce his name as Ambesica? [SPEAKER_E]: What? Did my car call you or something today? Sounds like some robot. [SPEAKER_C]: Hey. Well, you're saying it to Paul. Sorry. Hey, so what are you. [SPEAKER_E]: Butter Minute left. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm my votes for Mitch. [SPEAKER_E]: Why aren't you the werewolf? Because I'm the insomniac. I'm not gonna convince you. That's gonna be my. My attempt here. If I was a werewolf, I'd get defensive. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm not gonna get defensive veteran like Eddie Vedder is that? [SPEAKER_C]: Yes. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay. [SPEAKER_E]: Mitch, are you a werewolf? [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_B]: Fuck, he's not. [SPEAKER_E]: You were like, here, let me move all of the parts of my face really subtly to confuse you about if. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm lying or not. So. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't think Mitch is a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: I do. [SPEAKER_D]: Well then why don't we vote left. [SPEAKER_C]: Because then James gets to vote for Mitchell. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, you can do that. But Paul knows he's a werewolf too. [SPEAKER_E]: So only 36. Who are you suspicious of? Mitchell. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, that is sweet. I know, I know, I know. Paul. [SPEAKER_C]: No, I think he would. I think he'd be getting defensive at this point. [SPEAKER_B]: No, I don't think so. [SPEAKER_C]: I think he would be. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't think he would be. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm not killing Mitchell because you guys. [SPEAKER_E]: I think he feels too safe. [SPEAKER_B]: You guys are both. [SPEAKER_E]: Sweet story. I'm voting for Mitchell. I don't know what to say. I was insomniac woke up the insomniac. [SPEAKER_B]: Getting a lot of I can't wait to murder an innocent person. [SPEAKER_E]: We all have to go to the. [SPEAKER_A]: Scene. [SPEAKER_C]: As soon as he."}

You may look at another player's card or two of the center cards. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm gonna look at two of the center cards. [SPEAKER_D]: Sounds good. [SPEAKER_B]: Sounds good. Oh, interesting. [SPEAKER_A]: Close your eyes. Robert, wake up. You may exchange your card with another player. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm gonna rob Justin. [SPEAKER_D]: Sounds good. [SPEAKER_B]: Actually, no.

[SPEAKER_E]: Stay asleep. Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: James. That's right. [SPEAKER_D]: Peanut butter babe. Laura. Laura, Peanut butter babe says your hair is amazing. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, thanks. I'm trying to fix it. Paul. [SPEAKER_D]: Has a peanut butter. [SPEAKER_C]: Just tried to take that complimen. I tried to. I just was a little conceited and assumed it was for me. [SPEAKER_D]: I was the troublemaker, and I did switch people. [SPEAKER_B]: Sorry. [SPEAKER_C]: I was a seer. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm not a hole in that information until we start finding. [SPEAKER_C]: Fascinating. I was a seer, and I know there's a werewolf out there. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, snap. [SPEAKER_E]: High five. [SPEAKER_C]: Fascinating. But now we should be worried about who he switched. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm not here until I hear everybody's. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm not gonna say anything. [SPEAKER_B]: It wasn't me. I was one of these three. [SPEAKER_D]: So you're pointing to a villager robber or insomniac? [SPEAKER_B]: Villager robber. Insomniac are my possibilities. Well, I started out as a village. [SPEAKER_D]: Started out as a. Started out as a villager. [SPEAKER_B]: That sounds like a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: All right, James, so that leaves you with two werewolves as your option. [SPEAKER_C]: Were you renovated or were you this one? [SPEAKER_E]: I was this. [SPEAKER_D]: And you saw that? [SPEAKER_B]: Are you. [SPEAKER_E]: So who'd you switch? [SPEAKER_D]: I switched you with somebody. [SPEAKER_E]: Whoa. [SPEAKER_C]: So you would know the answer. [SPEAKER_E]: Who? [SPEAKER_C]: What did you see, Mitchell? I saw two in the middle, and they were not werewolves. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, that makes sense. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, did you see that one? [SPEAKER_D]: You did not see troublemaker, right? [SPEAKER_C]: No, I did not so. [SPEAKER_D]: All right. Paul, can we get some. Can you remove. Okay, I know which one of those. [SPEAKER_C]: Three Paul is, because I. Two of those three I saw. [SPEAKER_D]: Nice. Well, why don't you just out him? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, let's see what he says. [SPEAKER_E]: That's. You can't just do that to a guy like Paul. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, so, Mitch, you can confirm I was a good guy. You've already. Why'd you move this one over here? [SPEAKER_D]: Because the villager's boring. So I'm just gonna. [SPEAKER_B]: You've already. You've already confirmed that I'm a good guy because you can. You know which one I am. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, I know which two you aren't, but. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. So of these three, you basically. [SPEAKER_E]: Sure. [SPEAKER_B]: Accidentally confirmed that I am one of the three. Sure. So I was a good guy. So did you switch me with James Lord? [SPEAKER_E]: Did you. [SPEAKER_D]: Did you pick villager? [SPEAKER_E]: Just so you didn't have to play the game. You could just be quiet. I think Laura's the werewolf now. [SPEAKER_D]: But you were the werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Guys. [SPEAKER_E]: To gank a villager. [SPEAKER_D]: I just need. I need. I want to know if what you are. Because that's. I don't want to give bad news to you until I can see your face. [SPEAKER_B]: Here's the thing, Laura. If I'm lying, if I'm not the insomniac, and she was the insomniac and you switched her, you're saying you should make. She could have woken up as James's werewolf, and this villager could be one of the three of mine. Or actually one of the ones in here. [SPEAKER_E]: So who. Who Mitch saw two in the middle. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Was one of them a villager? Will you tell us that? [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_E]: Give us one of them. [SPEAKER_C]: No, one of them was not a villager. [SPEAKER_E]: Give us one of them. [SPEAKER_C]: So I saw. Oh, so that gives a lot of. [SPEAKER_B]: Info, what I saw. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, if you guys can narrow it down. What I saw was the robber and insomniac. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, it was these two you saw. So that's what we're saying right now. [SPEAKER_B]: For me to ask. [SPEAKER_D]: You guys are both villagers. [SPEAKER_E]: I think Lore is the werewolf now. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, well, I switched James and Paul, so you were the werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Unless James. Unless Justin is actually. [SPEAKER_D]: So you were the werewolf. All right, I switched you two. No, no, you and Paul. I didn't switch James. I didn't touch James. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, you were just confirming. Yeah, you were doing my strategy. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, here's a fun story. I know Paul's a dirty fucking liar because I was a villager. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, right, I forgot. So, Carol, Mitchell, Mitch, should we vote for Mitch? Y agree. Let's. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: Let we have a minute left, which is worth having in our village. [SPEAKER_D]: Honestly, I'm going to kill James if you guys are. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm a villager. No. No one believes that. [SPEAKER_E]: No, Paul's a liar. [SPEAKER_B]: Started the game with I was because. [SPEAKER_E]: I want to see what other people would. [SPEAKER_B]: Here's the thing. [SPEAKER_D]: If Paul is a werewolf, he's about to lose if we vote for you. And he's going to vote for you. [SPEAKER_E]: Why? Why is he here? [SPEAKER_D]: Because Mitch is currently the werewolf. If that's the case. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, yeah, I was like, what? No, I would be if I was werewolf. But yeah, because Mitch would be. [SPEAKER_E]: You know why Mitch? [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_E]: Because you switched pawns. [SPEAKER_B]: Gotcha. [SPEAKER_E]: So I'll gank Mitch again. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I think we killed James. [SPEAKER_C]: I agree. [SPEAKER_E]: No. Ready to vote. Suspicious. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm not following this at all. So he told us he was the werewolf right at the beginning. [SPEAKER_D]: Because I said. I said. [SPEAKER_B]: And then when. When Justin said, no, he didn't actually switch James and somebody. It was actually me and Mitch. [SPEAKER_D]: He. So he admitted he was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: So he didn't actually move. So he's still the werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: No, no, I was never a werewolf. I was a villager. And Paul's alive. [SPEAKER_D]: We killed James. [SPEAKER_B]: And if Paul is lying, I would say the Midwest because he got switched with three."}

[SPEAKER_E]: Wait, so I'm a villager now? [SPEAKER_C]: Yes. Yeah. And, yeah, you're the robber. [SPEAKER_B]: All right. [SPEAKER_C]: So do we kill James because he hasn't said anything else? [SPEAKER_B]: What about Paul? [SPEAKER_D]: This is, like, a little suspicious to me that this is all just falling into place. [SPEAKER_C]: I believe it. You said insomniac, like, right away. Did you wake up as the insomniac? I believe this a hundred percent, that I don't even want to take time overthinking it. Like, I'm ready to vote to the left. [SPEAKER_B]: Vote to the left. There is no werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: We're all just working together. Laura's trying to Suss James out. [SPEAKER_D]: You were. [SPEAKER_C]: He was. He's a robber now. [SPEAKER_D]: Not to pick on you, but to pick on you. Sorry. [SPEAKER_C]: Did. [SPEAKER_D]: Was anyone able to confirm your story, or did you. [SPEAKER_C]: Mitch, could you. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, you confirmed your story. You switched these. Her and him. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: And you. So we're a nice, happy town after that last yelling round. So I think we all vote to the left. [SPEAKER_B]: Does anyone doesn't want to go to a vote at this point? [SPEAKER_D]: I think I'm caught up. [SPEAKER_B]: Could Justin be a werewolf? [SPEAKER_C]: I could probably, but I'm not. [SPEAKER_B]: When did you claim troublemaker? [SPEAKER_C]: I would switch everyone else before anyone else. [SPEAKER_B]: Fascinating. [SPEAKER_C]: I said I'm the troublemaker, and I switched James with somebody, and James then said villager, then Paul said insomniac. You said seer. You said seer. Sometime in that. And then you were the last to say robber. But you're confirming a story. So we kill Mitchell. [SPEAKER_B]: Rip. [SPEAKER_C]: Rip Mitchell. [SPEAKER_B]: So what are we doing? We think there are two werewolves in the middle. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: And you saw villager and werewolf when you were seer, right? Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Villager and werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: All right. I'd be ready to vote if you guys are. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm just. Honestly, now I'm worried about James because I feel like he's just, like, silent. No, because he would. He would want to say that he isn't the werewolf now because Laura has his card. All right, I'm good to go to the left. And I think if someone's a werewolf here, you won because we were all a happy, loving town. [SPEAKER_B]: So speak up if you don't want to go to vote now. Okay, I'm going. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah.

[SPEAKER_D]: I was one of these two, but nice. James Cyr. Or an insomniac. Or a werewolf. Okay. Okay. So those are two you saw in the center. [SPEAKER_C]: Snap. [SPEAKER_B]: No. No. [SPEAKER_D]: So, Mitch, are you doing this as protection, just in case? [SPEAKER_C]: I was just trying to be goofy. [SPEAKER_D]: There's no way we don't have a werewolf this round. [SPEAKER_C]: Can you verify your story? [SPEAKER_B]: I can. I'll tell you this. I know which one of you is a villager. [SPEAKER_D]: One of these two. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, that's good. That's good. [SPEAKER_F]: Well, it's me because I went to sleep as a villager. [SPEAKER_C]: Could be both. We could both be villagers. [SPEAKER_F]: That's true. But then someone would have to be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm gonna die again. [SPEAKER_B]: I. Justin. The way that Justin picked his possibilities and said, I know I'm the troublemaker was very similar to a couple rounds he did when we played last time, where he was lying both times that he. [SPEAKER_D]: I always change things up just to keep it fresh. [SPEAKER_C]: Here's the thing. If there's a werewolf out there, they would care who you switched. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. No one's asking. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't give a fuck. [SPEAKER_D]: I say. [SPEAKER_C]: Don't say. [SPEAKER_D]: Sure, I won't. [SPEAKER_B]: Fuck that. [SPEAKER_D]: I won't. [SPEAKER_B]: Don't say. [SPEAKER_D]: These two guesses. I can't switch myself. Oh, us as werewolves? [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: James is just pouty. He's not saying a word anymore. [SPEAKER_E]: No, but I can't because you guys can't both be cuz one of us is center. Oh my. [SPEAKER_B]: Says you. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, says me. [SPEAKER_D]: So Paul can confirm one of the. [SPEAKER_B]: Werewolf that saw a seer. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I don't think James is a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: This turn I'm going to be 100% he also honest with you. I was a seer. I was looking at the insomniac and Paul said, is someone just honestly. And that's when I like lifted the other card, looked at Paul and set that one down. I think it was brown. [SPEAKER_D]: What? Oh, this one? [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, I was. [SPEAKER_E]: I was looking at that one. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: And then I went to lift that. All right. That's pretty specific. Believe you. Paul said someone obviously look. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, that's a fabricated story. [SPEAKER_B]: That's like, okay, you're not gonna say who you. Who you moved and I'm not gonna say who I robbed then either. No one cares because if you're lying or if you're lying. Yeah, I robbed one of you. You would care if I. I don't care. And you would care marriage. [SPEAKER_E]: If I don't care, I'll vote to the left. I don't. No one needs to die. [SPEAKER_C]: I feel like if we all vote. [SPEAKER_B]: To left, somebody's gonna. [SPEAKER_C]: How many times have we voted to the left so far? Twice. [SPEAKER_F]: And then there's always. [SPEAKER_C]: And there's been a werewolf every time. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, but there also could not be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: No, we. We didn't vote to left. So I'm just gonna say or Justin got killed. But we have. [SPEAKER_D]: I did switch people. I did. I'm not saying who. So if you're concerned about losing the game as a werewolf, you should be concerned. [SPEAKER_B]: I think you should. If they are a werewolf, then they're gonna try to pin it on somebody if they know they got switched. Like, I think we were not gonna get the information until you say same thing with. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I know. [SPEAKER_B]: Same thing with me robbing. Except I do. I know that my information will only protect. [SPEAKER_D]: I'll just say. I'll say one person. I did not steal. I did not switch with. I did not switch James. So do we have no stress from anybody? [SPEAKER_C]: No, none here. [SPEAKER_D]: No stress. Laura, you're happy as a villager. [SPEAKER_E]: Laura's always stressed. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, that's a tiny field mouse. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_F]: No, I'm a villager. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I'm a villager. I have nothing to be worried about. [SPEAKER_D]: There's just no one fighting. The only people fighting are like the troublemaker and the robber. So I think we just vote left. [SPEAKER_B]: I just don't want to vote. [SPEAKER_D]: Then kill me and I'll die again. And that's the life I'll lead. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: I robbed from Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: Cool. [SPEAKER_B]: So Mitchell's the robber, I'm the villager. So I can confirm Mitchell was cool. [SPEAKER_C]: So what if she was? [SPEAKER_B]: So my only suspicion and possibility right now is Laura. [SPEAKER_F]: But I'm not a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Because last time you were a werewolf, you said you were the villager. [SPEAKER_C]: Ooh, good observation. [SPEAKER_D]: Good memory. [SPEAKER_F]: Good memory this time. [SPEAKER_D]: Because you know what you should do also? Bring your charger. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Why? [SPEAKER_D]: How does it charge? [SPEAKER_E]: Charger? [SPEAKER_C]: It's a pretty fast charger. Oh, how does it charge? [SPEAKER_B]: It's the new USB. Important things in 30 seconds. [SPEAKER_D]: This is important. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, but not time sensitive. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm gonna say. If she was a werewolf and she got a look at one in the center, it most likely would have been one of the two closest to her. But you verified that it was. So let's say that was the situation. [SPEAKER_D]: I think we vote left. [SPEAKER_C]: I think we vote left. [SPEAKER_A]: In my opinion, everyone just."}

You may look at another player's card or two of the center cards. [SPEAKER_B]: I know that the timing of this never changes, but this slower tempo music, Seer, makes me feel like. [SPEAKER_A]: Need help? Robber, wake up. You may exchange your card with another player's card and then view your new card. Robber, close your eyes. I got a T. Troublemaker, wake up.

Now, James, he found the Tanner and the Insomniac in the center. That's bullshit because I'm the insomniac. [SPEAKER_C]: What the. You're the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: Maybe. [SPEAKER_C]: Maybe you're the Tanner. Who knows? I'm a villager. [SPEAKER_D]: Who knows? I'm a villager. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm the insomniac. [SPEAKER_C]: Why do you think he's lying? [SPEAKER_E]: Because I looked at those cards. [SPEAKER_D]: That's crazy. Because if you're a werewolf and you fucking lied about what you are and what you saw, that's like, three variables that you could, like, only possibly have, like, information about one. And you're just like, yeah, I'll just do it. Which is very much, though it seems to be, like, your strategy. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Can anyone verify either of these stories? We gotta. [SPEAKER_B]: No one can. No one can. No one can verify my story because I woke up as the insomniac. [SPEAKER_D]: Mmm. [SPEAKER_B]: We need some other people talking. [SPEAKER_D]: I can't confirm anything because I was a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_B]: Nice. Got there. [SPEAKER_C]: This is a dangerous round. [SPEAKER_B]: I can confirm you did not switch me. [SPEAKER_D]: I was like, how? I understood. Because you're singing your insomnia. [SPEAKER_C]: Hey. Interesting. [SPEAKER_D]: If. [SPEAKER_C]: If he was lying, then he wouldn't have been able to confirm that without risk. [SPEAKER_D]: Mm. [SPEAKER_C]: But he said it confidently. [SPEAKER_D]: What this kind of says to me is, James knows he's the Tanner. This is a possibility. He knows he's the Tanner. So he's going to say that that's one of the cards in there, because then the Tanner's not going to lie about being. Or not if. Okay. [SPEAKER_E]: What the. Laura? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: What's Laura? Laura, what are you. [SPEAKER_D]: Hold on. Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Laura's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm confused. [SPEAKER_E]: I Think Laura might be. [SPEAKER_B]: I think Laura might be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: I mean, that's the way things are looking. But also, there is this conflict we cannot ignore between stories. [SPEAKER_B]: I think James might be the Tanner. I think Justin is also. I am the insomniac. [SPEAKER_D]: And I woke up, which is really interesting because Laura may be one of the people that I switched. [SPEAKER_B]: You did not switch her with me because I woke up as the insomniac. [SPEAKER_D]: That makes me believe Justin a bit too, because actually, I didn't switch Justin with her. [SPEAKER_B]: How does it feel to be lying about being the villager right now, by the way? She has to sit on information. [SPEAKER_D]: Feels good. [SPEAKER_B]: I was the insomniac. This is a problem. [SPEAKER_E]: He's lying. No, I'm not. [SPEAKER_B]: I think James is the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: I think James is the tanner as well. He did that right away because he chose the tanner as one of the cards in the center. [SPEAKER_B]: If j. I think James, like, this is a good gambit to be as the Tanner, not as much as the werewolf. Because like you said, you're lying about three things. Yeah, but if he is a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: It totally puts him. [SPEAKER_B]: Puts us off the track of James. [SPEAKER_D]: Here's the awkward part that comes into play. [SPEAKER_B]: You switched James. [SPEAKER_D]: I didn't switch James. I didn't switch James. [SPEAKER_B]: So you switched Laura and Mish. [SPEAKER_D]: I switched Lauren Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: Dang. [SPEAKER_D]: Were you a werewolf? [SPEAKER_B]: I was a werewolf. That means you are a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Please tell me you're trapping her. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm not. [SPEAKER_C]: Please save my life. [SPEAKER_B]: I think we gotta kill Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: I mean, I have no defense. I was a villager. [SPEAKER_B]: Suddenly someone made some trouble, and I'm a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: I've grown some fur. [SPEAKER_D]: I've grown some fur. [SPEAKER_B]: I think we gotta kill Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: I kind of agree. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: But what the fuck? [SPEAKER_D]: What the fuck is James gonna do if we decide to kill Mitchell? [SPEAKER_B]: He's gonna vote for me. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, but he can't. Okay. As a Tanner, he can't screw up the vote. I'm not trying to vote for the left, so he can't do that. Like, take us down. [SPEAKER_B]: You can't do the mic plan. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Cursive mic plan. Chat didn't like that plan. [SPEAKER_D]: I'll vote with you because I'm a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm scared. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, you can't vote for yourself. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, here's the thing again, because. Okay, so I was a seer. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: And one minute. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm terrible at being this year because last time, like, I forgot the first card I looked. Or the second card I forgot the first card I looked at because I was like, oh, the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: He's a funny guy. [SPEAKER_E]: I saw brown hair, could have been the robber. No one claimed him. So Justin's story might very well check out. But I'm sticking to my guns. [SPEAKER_D]: I feel pretty. Why is there werewolf on you? [SPEAKER_B]: Because that's what James thinks I am. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. Yeah. Because I feel pretty good about what Justin said because he. We sort of, like, verified each other's stories based on trust. [SPEAKER_E]: I'll. I'll fucking elbow Mitchell. There must be blood. [SPEAKER_A]: Time is up, everyone. [SPEAKER_C]: Thank three."}

What do we think about Alvin? He's being called. So I basically have put my heart out on a sleeve for you. Alvin's a villager. Yeah, I'm definitely a villager. What? So who are you? I'm the troublemaker. I switched. Me and Albin. I think Mitch is the werewolf, cuz he saying that. Oh, the villager who does dick just t. Mitchell. It's Mitchell. I'm on board with Mitchell now.

[SPEAKER_B]: No, I want to hear what people are because I always get screwed. I always get screwed. [SPEAKER_E]: I'd like to hear what people are as well. Why don't we do an order and. [SPEAKER_C]: Then just want to just whoever wants to offer information first. [SPEAKER_E]: Go. I was a villager. I had nothing either way. [SPEAKER_C]: Can anyone verify it? [SPEAKER_D]: Yep. [SPEAKER_B]: How can you verify it? [SPEAKER_C]: Robert? [SPEAKER_D]: This is the standing. Just like you and I last time and fucked us, Solomon. Don't me. [SPEAKER_E]: I won't. I believe you, Mitch. [SPEAKER_B]: What were you. [SPEAKER_C]: I was with Seer and I can verify one of their stories. [SPEAKER_B]: I was the seer. [SPEAKER_C]: You liar. [SPEAKER_B]: No, that was just. No. [SPEAKER_C]: So Justin's trying to find his way out at this point. [SPEAKER_B]: You guys can vote for me. [SPEAKER_C]: I can verify Elvis story. Who can you verify? [SPEAKER_B]: I looked at cards in the middle. [SPEAKER_D]: So how can you verify one person's. [SPEAKER_B]: I can't verify anyone's story. [SPEAKER_D]: You said you could verify one person's. [SPEAKER_B]: No. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, you did. [SPEAKER_B]: No, I didn't. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, you did. Did you not say that? [SPEAKER_B]: No, I said I want to hear anyone else before I start talking. [SPEAKER_D]: But then when we did this, Mitchell. [SPEAKER_B]: Said he verified Alvin's story. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't. I don't remember Justin saying that. I don't think. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, maybe it was you Fist bump Fisk. [SPEAKER_B]: Fiskus. [SPEAKER_C]: I think so. Mitch, if you were this year, what did you see? I saw Albin's card. That's the one I. [SPEAKER_B]: You saw a villager? The safest card to see. [SPEAKER_D]: Yes. [SPEAKER_C]: And that's why I was like I'm just gonna hold back here and wait for. [SPEAKER_D]: What did you see in the middle? [SPEAKER_B]: I saw a werewolf and a drunk. [SPEAKER_D]: Show me. [SPEAKER_C]: So then one of those were. We all think that one of those were sitting there. We all think that one of those were sitting there. [SPEAKER_D]: I like Justin's confidence. [SPEAKER_C]: I think Justin is grappling. [SPEAKER_D]: I like Justin for a way out. [SPEAKER_C]: And he's throwing me under the bus right now. [SPEAKER_E]: I think Justin's the werewolf and Mitch is the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: You know, in all fairness, one of us is really good to be the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: I was like, oh, man, the tanner would be great. [SPEAKER_D]: No, this is. I guarantee you this is how it is. I am so confident. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, my God. You are about to lose us the game again. [SPEAKER_D]: No matter what anyone says, my vote is Mitchell. [SPEAKER_E]: I think just. I still stand by Justin werewolf Mitch Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: Can I know why? [SPEAKER_E]: What's that? [SPEAKER_B]: Kind of why me. [SPEAKER_C]: And not just throwing me under the bus right now. And you are being. [SPEAKER_B]: At the Tanner. He'd want to be hung, right? [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: And he is being no one. Oh, he's being. He's playing. [SPEAKER_C]: You're fucking throwing me. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm with you on this 100. [SPEAKER_C]: The reason he gave no information and claiming the. The seer is because he had no information. He was the goddamn werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. This information right here, you also could. [SPEAKER_E]: Have looked at one of those and you were the werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: It's true. It's true. [SPEAKER_C]: Maybe he saw the other werewolf. Maybe. Actually, even if you saw James and. [SPEAKER_E]: I know James and I have, like, the same. [SPEAKER_C]: I believe both of you. Well, yeah. What? Yeah. You verified your story. I know. I know you're telling the truth. [SPEAKER_E]: Unless James is, like, just. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm not listening to it. I hesitated last time and I fucked the game up. I guarantee you that when we change cards, this is what you. [SPEAKER_B]: I honestly think what's happening is we have no werewolf and Mitch is the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. What if just Justin could be the Tanner by claiming the same role someone else has. Is a great way of getting. [SPEAKER_B]: It's very true. [SPEAKER_E]: We could still win if we just say they're both the werewolf and then he turns out to be the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I guarantee you, Alvin, I guarantee you this is how it stands. I'm that confident. [SPEAKER_E]: His gut. I think one of them is a Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: So if I was a seer and he. And he was a Tanner, that would be a great opportunity to say. After I said, I'm a seer, he goes, wait, I'm a seer. And then there's suspicion. So that could be an attempt to be a tame. Well, I said mine first. [SPEAKER_B]: In all fairness, a Seer is also a good one. When someone has already claimed something to verify someone else's story. Something that I did earlier got me a lot of heat. [SPEAKER_C]: If I was a werewolf, that means that I claimed Seer before I heard what everyone else said. That means I would use. [SPEAKER_E]: He heard what we both said and then you used me to verify whatever it is. [SPEAKER_D]: They're not both werewolves. Cause they're fighting. So I guarantee you it's Mitchell as a werewolf. And Justin. I don't know what the Justin. Okay, so. [SPEAKER_C]: So work on what you think he is. [SPEAKER_D]: That fits with that. [SPEAKER_B]: All right, we gotta vote right away. [SPEAKER_E]: For Justin, I think. [SPEAKER_C]: Wow, it's Justin and he's making you a sucker for. [SPEAKER_D]: It's Mitchell. [SPEAKER_A]: Two, one. [SPEAKER_B]: Let's not reveal. Let's think. [SPEAKER_D]: What Chat thinks is that this chat. [SPEAKER_B]: Think it's the time we both die. [SPEAKER_C]: We would both die. [SPEAKER_D]: Why do you both die? [SPEAKER_C]: Because of the time both people die. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Alvin, you fucked us. I told you not to fuck us. [SPEAKER_C]: There's no more talking. It's over. [SPEAKER_B]: Show a reveal. [SPEAKER_C]: Mitch would get chosen because Justin would be Tanner than because he would win. So you don't hang him. So no matter what, you hang Mitch. [SPEAKER_B]: Shall we reveal? [SPEAKER_C]: Good job, James. Well done. I thought you were too obviously the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm so sorry that I did this to you. Last round, I told you no werewolves. [SPEAKER_C]: I thought that was way too. See, Haru thought there's no werewolves. But I was a werewolf. I guaranteed it. [SPEAKER_D]: I was so confident there. [SPEAKER_E]: I totally thought, I will never go. [SPEAKER_D]: On the other side. [SPEAKER_E]: There's no way you would actually be the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, got me. [SPEAKER_B]: All right, so I'm liking. I'm liking going dark. [SPEAKER_E]: I totally overthought that. Can you like. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: I did not do a good job that way. I thought you were. I thought you were like, James, your. [SPEAKER_B]: Left hand on the table, like nine minus like your fingers on the edge. Yeah, just like out like this. Like I am. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, wait, like this? [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Why? [SPEAKER_B]: I think the table's a bit too far towards you guys. When we knocked the table. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, we knocked it that way. [SPEAKER_B]: James, can you go like that again, please? Yeah, that's good enough for me. Oh, man. [SPEAKER_E]: This game is great. [SPEAKER_B]: This game is good. [SPEAKER_E]: It's really smart. [SPEAKER_B]: So I think we're gonna play one more round, then we're gonna go over and play a bit of Spyfall. It's a game very much like this. It's a deduction game. [SPEAKER_E]: I kind of want to try the new Q game. Is that too. Too intense? [SPEAKER_B]: We can do it. [SPEAKER_E]: Is it like. [SPEAKER_D]: Is it an old game? [SPEAKER_B]: No, no. KU's really short. It's just. [SPEAKER_D]: May I just look? [SPEAKER_B]: Of course. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. Okay. So there's Heavy Rider. [SPEAKER_B]: I already mentioned. I looked at it. It could be fun. Here, let's. We'll play one round of Spyfall. [SPEAKER_C]: Sure. [SPEAKER_B]: And we'll see how we're feeling after that one. And then we'll play KOO Rebellion if there's still for still time and mood. [SPEAKER_E]: Sure. [SPEAKER_D]: Where's the Duke? [SPEAKER_C]: Lucky Duke. [SPEAKER_B]: I gotta stand up. [SPEAKER_D]: No, it's not. It's the same one. [SPEAKER_E]: Lucky Duke Cooper, remember Lucky Duke, though. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, Lucky Duke. [SPEAKER_E]: Lucky Duke. [SPEAKER_D]: Lucky Duke. Not so shocked. [SPEAKER_B]: Thank you, everyone who's come in and watch tonight. It's been tons of fun. I hope you're in your. I'm hoping you're enjoying one night Ultimate Werewolf. Because we definitely are foreign counselor. [SPEAKER_D]: Who's the farmer? [SPEAKER_B]: So far, I don't see anyone I like. [SPEAKER_D]: Justin, it's you, the writer. It's you and Emily Blunt. [SPEAKER_B]: It is me and Emily Blunt. If we would merge together. [SPEAKER_D]: Justin and Emily Blunt. [SPEAKER_B]: I love that. James is a wrecking ball to logic and planning. So Michelle saying we're gonna play one more round of Ultimate Werewolf, then Spyfall. [SPEAKER_D]: Great. [SPEAKER_B]: And then after one round of Spyfall, we'll see if we want to play another one or if we just jump over and do some. [SPEAKER_C]: We'll play it another one. I guarantee they'll love it. That is me. Actually, it looks. I mean, physically. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Let's play two Rebellion. [SPEAKER_B]: Wait, wait, wait. [SPEAKER_D]: I only got two more. I only got two more. Capitalist White and the banker. Okay, what's this stuff at the back? Oh, it goes the other. [SPEAKER_B]: Shall we? [SPEAKER_D]: Genius. [SPEAKER_B]: Look at this. [SPEAKER_E]: Sold on the packaging. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, yeah, Good. [SPEAKER_B]: Let's go for one more blind night of Ultimate Werewolf. One Night Fever. [SPEAKER_D]: He's gonna complete the spell this round. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't think Skyfall is a fun game, but I think James would mess it up all the time. [SPEAKER_D]: Who is this? [SPEAKER_B]: Don't worry about it, James. [SPEAKER_E]: Don't worry about it, James. [SPEAKER_D]: Don't worry. [SPEAKER_B]: We're just gonna go into this. All right, guys, we're going dark. Actually, let's deal these out first. [SPEAKER_E]: They've got it out for you, man. [SPEAKER_D]: Whatever. [SPEAKER_B]: In all fairness, you are Wrecking Ball. They're not wrong. That's what makes me more angry. [SPEAKER_D]: We gotta give us some space. Give us some space. [SPEAKER_B]: All right, let's go dark, shall we? [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: Good night, everyone. See you in the morning. [SPEAKER_A]: Everyone, close your eyes. [SPEAKER_B]: Robert. [SPEAKER_A]: Werewolves, wake up and look for other werewolves. If there is only. [SPEAKER_B]: Look for other werewolves. [SPEAKER_C]: And then James snickered and then I couldn't hold it in anymore. Oh, Lord, just. You laughed. [SPEAKER_D]: When. [SPEAKER_E]: When Mitch and I were werewolves, we just, like, looked at each other and nodded and then, like, kept on. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: On Mitch's face. [SPEAKER_C]: God damn it. That would have been so great. It would have been. Fuck. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, when you look up as a werewolf, don't. [SPEAKER_B]: Don't look at her car. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay? [SPEAKER_B]: Jeez. Illuminati. All right, we're going dark again. [SPEAKER_D]: What? [SPEAKER_E]: All right, whoa. [SPEAKER_A]: Everyone close your eyes. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm pissed because I was the drunk in the last one. [SPEAKER_A]: Look for other werewolves. If there is only one werewolf, you may look at a card from the center. Werewolves, Close your eyes. [SPEAKER_B]: See? [SPEAKER_A]: Wake up. You may look at another player's card or two of the center cards. Seer, close your eyes. [SPEAKER_B]: Robert, wake up. [SPEAKER_A]: You may exchange your card with another player's card and then view your new card. Robber, close your eyes. Drunk, wake up and exchange your card with a card from the center. Drunk. Close your eyes. Everyone, keep your eyes closed and reach out and move your card around slightly. [SPEAKER_B]: Sorry. [SPEAKER_D]: Sorry, Alan. [SPEAKER_A]: Everyone, wake up. [SPEAKER_B]: I just want everyone to know I haven't been opening up my eyes a bit early just to turn the webcam back on. Just everybody knows. All right. How was everybody's night? [SPEAKER_D]: It was good. [SPEAKER_B]: Let's none of us talk for this whole one and we just vote at the end. [SPEAKER_C]: We'll wait for James Gut to tell us who to vote for. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. Who do you think you should vote for? James. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. Without even saying anything else. Just throw a name out there. [SPEAKER_D]: There's nowhere else. It's a happy village. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, does anyone want to be the first one to talk? [SPEAKER_E]: I have an idea, but I can tell you guys why I have that idea. [SPEAKER_D]: Afterwards. After, when. [SPEAKER_E]: I think Just is the werewolf. This is just. [SPEAKER_D]: How? [SPEAKER_C]: On a scale of 1 to 10, how confident are you? [SPEAKER_E]: I'd say an 8. [SPEAKER_B]: That's not a 10, which it should be. How? [SPEAKER_D]: Why do you think this? Why do you think this? If. Oh, how. [SPEAKER_B]: Was there a robber? Was there a robber? [SPEAKER_C]: I may or may not be a robber. [SPEAKER_B]: Alright, so we're exactly where we were before you answered that question. Alvin, can I know why you think I am the werewolf? [SPEAKER_E]: I was a seer. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay. Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, I'm suspicious with Mitch because I was the robber. [SPEAKER_E]: I think Mitch was the drunk. [SPEAKER_D]: And I can confirm Alvin's story. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, so now you're saying you're currently the seer. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay. [SPEAKER_E]: Did you. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you rob me? [SPEAKER_E]: So you robbed me. [SPEAKER_D]: I rob you. I'm the seer. [SPEAKER_C]: And then Mitch, using what I know, says he could. James's story doesn't make sense. [SPEAKER_E]: Why is that? [SPEAKER_D]: Why dream? What? You. [SPEAKER_C]: You fucking. [SPEAKER_D]: What? [SPEAKER_C]: Tell your story again. One more time. Exactly. You told it the first time. [SPEAKER_D]: You're. [SPEAKER_C]: You're a robber. [SPEAKER_D]: In the beginning, I'm a rob. [SPEAKER_E]: They could both be. [SPEAKER_B]: Why did you start this tangent and then not end it? [SPEAKER_D]: Why? [SPEAKER_C]: Jingle the lion, sack of shit. [SPEAKER_B]: No. Were you the robber? [SPEAKER_C]: I was the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: No, See, that's why I said I was the robber. And take issue with that when you said you were the robber, because I'm the. I was the fucking robber. [SPEAKER_E]: You were the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: I was the robber. [SPEAKER_E]: The only thing that, in my mind that's questionable is that there's more than one werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: I think there are two. I'm quite. I know one person's lying. [SPEAKER_D]: Throwing lots of hate out. [SPEAKER_C]: Melvin, I'll tell you what I think is happening. I think werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: I think you might be either the drunk or the Tanner bitch. [SPEAKER_C]: I was the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: That's a fucking lie. [SPEAKER_C]: That's how I know he's lying. [SPEAKER_E]: What would you do? [SPEAKER_D]: God damn it, Nej. Who did you rob? [SPEAKER_C]: I robbed you. And that's why I don't have that much information. [SPEAKER_D]: So if you robbed him. [SPEAKER_C]: He'S exactly what he claims he was. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, that was a bit of hesitation there. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Not even a solid answer. [SPEAKER_E]: I go with James on this one. [SPEAKER_B]: Here's another thing that could have happened. Say I was the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Mm. [SPEAKER_B]: What if James is the robber? Right. What if James is not the robber? Let's just say that. What if Mitch was the robber? [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: Situation. [SPEAKER_E]: What if one of them could have robbed you? Now he's the werewolf and he's trying to hop on this trip. [SPEAKER_B]: It could be diddle that for either of them. Correct. If I. If I am the werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Are you corporate like you? You agree that you were the werewolf at the beginning? [SPEAKER_B]: I'm not gonna say anything because I, you know, I don't. I don't even know if I want to believe you as the seer. Right. I don't want to know if I believe you as a robber. You as the robber. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, I can verify he's a seer. [SPEAKER_B]: And so that reason he, I'm quite. [SPEAKER_C]: Confident, would be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Remember when Mitchell said he's. [SPEAKER_C]: And I know he's lying. So in my eyes, it's kind of like a. It's black and white here. [SPEAKER_E]: I think it's Justin then. Unless someone. [SPEAKER_C]: I think we have. I think we have two werewolves. [SPEAKER_D]: So. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, actually, the only one I know for a fact is Justin, because through. [SPEAKER_E]: You, I think you're the Tanner and you're trying desperately to get us to kill you. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. James also also declared that you were that album moved this year. [SPEAKER_C]: No confirmed alibis. [SPEAKER_A]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, well, I know it was Justin. Whether or not someone else move it or there's a second werewolf, I don't know. [SPEAKER_D]: So you know Justin was a werewolf? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: And so someone. [SPEAKER_B]: So then here's the thing. If I'm the werewolf, why are they. [SPEAKER_C]: Both declaring Robert, there's a second werewolf here. [SPEAKER_B]: So which one is it? [SPEAKER_C]: So you're. You're admitting you are a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, then I want to know which one of you is the Tanner. If that's. I'll admit I'm the werewolf, but I want to know which one of you is going to lose along. [SPEAKER_C]: You know, one of us is a werewolf. One of us is a robber. [SPEAKER_B]: Both claim and robber here, everyone. [SPEAKER_C]: We're pretty confident that."}

It's like next time we. We play. I can shorten the time that he gives everyone now you get more. We're doing this. Yeah. Mitchell again. Let's get some information flowing here. All right. You want to start? You're the one on the. On the fucking. I started as a villager. That's what I was. That's what I was too. I did nothing. Really? I kept my eyes closed the whole time. Really? Yeah. And chatted. I chatted a little. That's cuz I'm not a good villager. I don't sleep at night. That's. It's funny you guys say that because as the troublemaker, I switched your guys cards. Okay? What? I was a villager. So you're a villager. Okay, so this lying. I'm not lying. But then he switched. You switch. I switched these two. Yeah. Yeah. So if Mitch is the werewolf, I'm probably the werewolf and I don't know it. But Alvin's also a liar. So I'm back to Mitchell being the werewolf. Unless Mitch lied about being a villager. Well, TikTok. Now I feel like I don't want to get gang, but okay. If one of you guys was the werewolf, which it was Mitchell, I absolutely know it was. Then you guys would. Were you say it. No. Why would it? I was the werewolf. I guess you're not werewolf. Alvin. What? What were you? Villager. Yeah, we were the troublemaker. I was the troublemaker and I switched. I think Mitchell's lying because I think it was the word. I think we should gank me. I think we should vote for. For James. I think James has been lying this whole time. We should gank me. I think Justin? Because nobody's been doing anything with Justin. He's a troublemaker. He switched us. I believe that to a T. Okay, no one cast doubt on it until this moment. I refuse to back down. Maybe we don't have. No, we have to have a werewolf because three be wolf claimed villager could have a robber and a seer. Wait, who did you. No, they would all claim it because robbers and sears are on the villagers team. I think we should gank me. Seriously? He thinks you were the werewolf. I literally think we should kill me. What happens if times run out and we don't? We just have to vote immediately. Okay. It'll say like at the end. It'll be like 3, 2, 1, vote. We all just point it. Whoever want to kill your vote's you. I vote James. I don't think it's Justin. I don't know why. That's where I was on the first round. But no evidence. No, I. I swapped their roles around. Yeah, okay. Yeah, Okay. I don't know. I think it's James. Do you want to do the vote then? He just thinks it's him. I think it's me. Should we vote? Should we go to vote? Sure. [SPEAKER_A]: Time is up, everyone. [SPEAKER_B]: Three."}

[SPEAKER_B]: You know, it would make something because. [SPEAKER_C]: We were happy village show. Someone's throwing he. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm usually. I'm usually the one who gets it twice in a row. But this time I am a villager. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, let me put it this way. Did anyone swap? Yeah, Justin's. Because I'm a seer, and I looked at it and he's a werewolf, I'm a villager. [SPEAKER_C]: I did nothing. I thought we were a happy village. [SPEAKER_E]: A werewolf would say that. Unless someone else was the seer. But if there was one werewolf, he got a look. Maybe he saw the seer. Maybe he's claiming maybe. So I think it's either Justin, maybe. [SPEAKER_C]: What are you missing? [SPEAKER_E]: Or Alvin. I'm just a villager. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, we have a problem. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, because are you. You guys are both villagers? [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: None of you switched any cards? [SPEAKER_E]: No. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, so now it's like a trust thing. [SPEAKER_E]: It is. [SPEAKER_D]: I was right the first two times. You gonna trust me on a third one? [SPEAKER_C]: No, because you're throwing out the trust card. [SPEAKER_D]: All right, that's cool. [SPEAKER_E]: So you were a seer. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. And I straight up looked at his card and it was the werewolf card. So unless one of you guys switched. [SPEAKER_E]: It around, I believe him. [SPEAKER_C]: My vote is still no werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Why no werewolf? [SPEAKER_B]: Hey, Waffle House, how's it going? [SPEAKER_D]: Jameslove's taking, like, a random thing and it just sticks. [SPEAKER_E]: So if there is no werewolf, why would Albin lie? If he's on the villager team, why would he lie? [SPEAKER_C]: You're right. He's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: It's got to be one of those two. [SPEAKER_C]: Why can't it be you, though? Because we don't have any villager tokens left. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, the tokens are just fucking. [SPEAKER_D]: He took it. [SPEAKER_E]: Now do you trust me now? [SPEAKER_B]: You fucking dumb. [SPEAKER_E]: But what if he did this? He has two werewolf tokens. [SPEAKER_B]: That's a follow. Sway Drewgen 10:27 thank you so much for following us. Welcome to the table. [SPEAKER_E]: I think Mike's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Mike's definitely the werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Maybe Rage. [SPEAKER_D]: I think it could be Mitch. Like, if there's a second werewolf, it could be like, any of us, I guarantee. I know Justin is a werewolf, but there could be more than. [SPEAKER_E]: If there's a second werewolf. If. If he's telling the truth and he's a werewolf and there's a second werewolf, he'd be defending Justin. [SPEAKER_D]: Except it could be. [SPEAKER_C]: What if they're both werewolves? [SPEAKER_E]: They wouldn't target. They would know. They would know each other. And they've already put targets on both their backs. I don't think they're both werewolves. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, how come there's no target near someone? Why do you believe I'm a villager? Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: You haven't shown an ounce of strategy yet. [SPEAKER_B]: That's usually James's strategy. [SPEAKER_D]: In all fairness, it could be. I think Justin. Well, I know justice the werewolf, but I think maybe I'm gonna trust Alvin. [SPEAKER_C]: It's just. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, because I, like, looked at it. [SPEAKER_E]: Let's go to a vote. I'm gonna trust Alvin too. Okay. Ready? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, I don't want.

[SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, two werewolves. This is how I see this flying. [SPEAKER_E]: So that is just pure gut. Yeah, fucking gut. [SPEAKER_D]: Fucking gut. Prove me wrong, Mitchell. [SPEAKER_E]: I have no information because I was a villager. [SPEAKER_A]: But we have the villager token. [SPEAKER_E]: Mitchell's lying. [SPEAKER_C]: I was a villager when I started, but maybe someone swapped it. [SPEAKER_E]: Since you were a villager when you started, no one else. You were claiming villager when you started. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, I got up. [SPEAKER_E]: So I know in my head that one of you are lying. [SPEAKER_A]: I. [SPEAKER_E]: So I know for a fact there's a werewolf here. [SPEAKER_C]: I think it's James. [SPEAKER_D]: No, it's Alvin. [SPEAKER_C]: Unless someone switched it again and like, I'm like the werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: I'm not gonna pull. I'm not gonna pull a. Mitchell. I was the robbery and I switched with one of you guys. [SPEAKER_E]: And what did you get? [SPEAKER_A]: I. I want to know if there was a seer or troublemaker involved as well. I'm not gonna go all the way until I get some. [SPEAKER_E]: There was a werewolf. There's one villager because they're both claiming villager. I'm gonna say one of them probably is a war. A villager and one of them's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: I could be the werewolf if you switched with me. No, wait. [SPEAKER_D]: Cuz the robber knows. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, Robber. [SPEAKER_A]: Cool, we'll play. Well, yeah, we'll play some other character cards after this round. [SPEAKER_E]: He knows that he. So you're a villager. I think I'm a village. [SPEAKER_D]: No, wait. [SPEAKER_C]: No, no. I would start a villager. [SPEAKER_E]: One of them is a robber and one of Them. [SPEAKER_D]: Justin. [SPEAKER_E]: The one that Justin did not switch with is the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, last time Justin was like, I'm this. [SPEAKER_A]: He just absolutely was not Cast games are forgotten. [SPEAKER_C]: If James started the werewolf and I started the villager, but you're attacking with James, then Justin might be the werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: He might be. But he said he might. He will reveal who he switched with as long as there's not a troublemaker here. So I think. I think Justin's confident with what he has. I think that what happened was he switched with the villager, whoever that was. Yeah. And now he wants to make sure there's not a troublemaker so that he knows he truly is on the good side. At this point. The question is, which one of you fuckers with lying at the beginning? [SPEAKER_D]: Mitchell's throwing a lot of heat out. [SPEAKER_E]: And Justin has the answer. Whichever one Justin didn't switch with is the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: How come he didn't switch with you? [SPEAKER_E]: How come Justin didn't switch with me? Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: You're only playing with our tiles. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, I'm just saying what I know from my head, and I know I'm a villager. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, I did in the start, so boom. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, but you were very quick to say you were a villager. [SPEAKER_D]: Because I'm a fucking villager. I do nothing but get to claim I'm a villager. [SPEAKER_E]: Who do you think it is? Because I trust you wholeheartedly in this one. Do you want to say who you swapped with? [SPEAKER_A]: Well, I want to know first if there was a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, I was a villager. [SPEAKER_E]: I was a villager. [SPEAKER_D]: I was a villager. [SPEAKER_E]: Would a troublemaker admit that there was a troublemaker? [SPEAKER_D]: So no one was a seer and no one was a troublemaker? [SPEAKER_E]: No, no one's admitting to it. Why would they lie? [SPEAKER_C]: What are those two werewolves? That. It's those guys. [SPEAKER_E]: And then I don't think they would lie. I don't think there is a serious. [SPEAKER_A]: I'll say who I switched with. I switched with Alvin, you fucking werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Son of a bitch. [SPEAKER_C]: He's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, I know I'm not a werewolf because I'm a seer. And the two middle cards. [SPEAKER_E]: What were the two middle cards? Okay, so I know there's not. [SPEAKER_D]: I know there's a werewolf and a troublemaker in there. [SPEAKER_E]: Your story has totally changed. [SPEAKER_A]: You guys want to go to a vote? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I think so. Because I think it's. I think it's Mitch. [SPEAKER_A]: You think it's Mitch? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: Oh, I think it's James. [SPEAKER_E]: James just got on board with voting. [SPEAKER_A]: For me because I thought it was. [SPEAKER_D]: You from the fucking get go. [SPEAKER_E]: It's either you or there's no werewolf. That's the only option it can be. [SPEAKER_D]: But I know there's a werewolf in there because I was a fucking cr. I know there's a troublemaker and a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: So you're this. I'm this. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. Because we switched. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: And then this is here. [SPEAKER_D]: So. [SPEAKER_E]: So you saw two cards and what did you see? [SPEAKER_D]: I saw a werewolf and a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_E]: You saw a werewolf and troublemaker. So it is possible there's two werewolves. If he's telling the truth, he's a seer. If he's telling a lie, he's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Maybe we don't have a werewolf this time. [SPEAKER_E]: Yes, yes, that's what I'm saying. Like, if you're telling the truth, then there's two werewolves in here. If you're telling. [SPEAKER_A]: We have 15 seconds. [SPEAKER_C]: I think it's Mitch. [SPEAKER_E]: He's kind of grasping. [SPEAKER_A]: I think it's James. [SPEAKER_C]: I think it's Mitch. What do we do in a tiebreaker? [SPEAKER_A]: I don't know. [SPEAKER_E]: We'll have to find out. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. [SPEAKER_E]: Alvin. [SPEAKER_C]: Why do you think it's me? [SPEAKER_A]: All right, that's all. Let's vote. [SPEAKER_E]: I don't know. [SPEAKER_A]: Why? Because time is up, everyone."}

He just snuck something into our brains. If you play Tanner, an easy way to make yourself known is to blame someone straight off the bat. Yeah. We have five minutes. I was a villager. I was. I was a robber. Who did you switch with? Or do you want more information? I want more information. Alright, so do we have a drunk among us? I was the drunk. So I could potentially be the werewolf. Because if I did anyone. Mitch, what were you? I was the seer. Who did you look at? I looked at Albans. Was he what he said he was? I don't know yet. Well, I mean, was he the drunk? I don't know. I don't know if I want to give that up yet. I want to know what James did. James, what? Who did you trade with? Me? Yeah. Well, I know I wasn't the robber. Why did you say. Oh, you were just trying to block early. Yeah. Why would you do that as a good person? You keep lying and putting so much suspicion on you. Just don't claim a role yet. Just wait because I just want to see if someone would fess up to what they were first. So the hunter is only a passive ability, right? That is responsive if he gets killed. Correct. Okay, so you looked at the drunk. Was he the drunk? I looked at Alvin's. He was not the drunk. I don't. What was I then? I'll wait a bit longer. For what? Why? I'll just tell you. You were not drunk. You and I both know whether that's a lie. That's a lying face if I've ever seen one. Alvin knows whether I'm lying or not, 110%. Is he lying, Alvin? I don't know. What do you mean? What the fuck? I don't Believe Mitchell's the seer. I saw Elvin's card. That could be true, though. I don't believe he's the seer. I saw his card and I know he didn't have the drunk. Elvin, it's. Sorry, it's one player card or two in the middle, right? First here. Yeah. Yeah. Alvin, which one did you switch with when you were the drunk? It was the middle one. In the middle. Yeah. What? How come you're just the villager? Because I am. How do we believe that? Because I'm the one leading the conversation and asking the question. Yeah. A werewolf wouldn't do that. Werewolf might. Because when you ask questions, you steer the conversation away from you. I think. I think it's Mitchell. Mitch, slow rolling the table. What, like dragging it? No, no. Slow rolling is keeping information, but holding certain bits of which is what he was doing. I don't. So if you believe me. I saw one of these on Alvin's card. If you believe me. It's a big preface. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Absolutely. Yeah. If you believe me. All right. I just instantly lost all belief in Mitchell. I think he might be the werewolf. I don't believe he's the seer. I was the seer. I do not believe that. Yeah. I don't know. I saw the werewolf. I saw him as a werewolf. No. And he knows whether I'm telling the truth or not. Alvin absolutely knows. I think Mitch is the one. I think Mitch? Yeah, Mitch. I'm going with Mitch. I think Alvin is. It's nice. I know. Alvin, it's Mitch. Yeah. Let's do the vote. All right. [SPEAKER_A]: Time is up, everyone."}

[SPEAKER_D]: The hunter. [SPEAKER_C]: I know he was the hunter because I was the seer and I saw that he was the hunter. [SPEAKER_D]: Could we possibly just not have werewolves? Like, I know as a hunter, that's something I shouldn't. [SPEAKER_E]: Let's just look at what we got so far by step. Is there any reason they would be lying in this manner that works with each other? [SPEAKER_B]: They're both the werewolf. But I was the robber. [SPEAKER_E]: I was only the villager. [SPEAKER_B]: I was the robber and I swapped with Alvin. [SPEAKER_E]: So you. If that's true, you would be able to verify his story. And he's verifying his story. Yes, and I'm the only one without a verified story. [SPEAKER_D]: Let's go make sure. [SPEAKER_C]: I think Justin's addendum was a little timely. So it could be Justin. [SPEAKER_D]: It could be. But I like Mitchell's little not verified argument. [SPEAKER_E]: But if you get me, it's just. It's a 50. 50 whether I'm a werewolf. If that's where we're at so far, I'm a hunter. [SPEAKER_C]: Tom takes my shots at Mitchell, Justin's stories. [SPEAKER_E]: But we could all. Maybe they could both be werewolves. [SPEAKER_D]: So, like. [SPEAKER_B]: But like, are you saying that you're not the seer? Because I'm confirming that you are. [SPEAKER_C]: I am the seer. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. I'm with you on that. [SPEAKER_D]: If you were the seer, but you saw me. [SPEAKER_C]: But you already know that I said I was the seer, so that's fair. [SPEAKER_E]: That's fair. [SPEAKER_B]: I was. As always, you know, with a robber, it's nice to wait and lay it tactically. I admit that I did that because, you know, I wanted to suss it out beforehand. Right. You don't have to trust me. It's fine. I trust you and I trust James. [SPEAKER_D]: Let's go, Mitch. [SPEAKER_E]: So here I am with a Completely unverified story. I have no information to give up. All I'm claiming I'm a villager. I don't know. A werewolf absolutely would do it. [SPEAKER_C]: It's almost too convenient, though. It's like, we might not have a. [SPEAKER_E]: Werewolf this time, but I still think. [SPEAKER_C]: It'S Justin for some reason. [SPEAKER_D]: What if it's these two fuckers? Al was just saying he was a seer. [SPEAKER_E]: Let's. Let's see if there could be a. [SPEAKER_D]: Combo of two going. No, I'm a hunter and I was up front with you guys, so I'm gonna pick my role and I'm gonna. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, that's why when I was the seer, I checked yours because I wanted to see if you're gonna actually. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, but that could be. [SPEAKER_E]: So it is possible, from your perspective and from mine, that they're both werewolves? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. I think I'm still firing shots at you. Just so you know. You gotta. Come on. [SPEAKER_E]: I am in a bad spot. I won't lie about that. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm believing. What? Like, I'm like, you know, I don't know if anyone is actually a werewolf here. Right. Right. [SPEAKER_D]: Neither do I. Yeah. But I feel like if anyone was, it's Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: I think it's Justin. Because I think if Justin is in. [SPEAKER_E]: A position where he could. [SPEAKER_C]: Mitch just kind of let it sit there and it turns out that, like, he's the only villager. [SPEAKER_D]: What if. What if they're both werewolves? [SPEAKER_E]: I'll be raised a good point. I don't know why I didn't see this. No one has verified Justin's story. I'm just as unverified as his story. [SPEAKER_B]: It's true. It's true. [SPEAKER_D]: No, he did say that earlier. You're the one who said you're the only unverified, therefore verifying his. [SPEAKER_B]: Albeit. If we're gonna put me on the table for my story coming after Albin' Alvin's story came after James's story. [SPEAKER_E]: But in he. His story is verified, in theory, by you. By me. [SPEAKER_B]: So I'm verifying James's story. So verified. [SPEAKER_E]: Verified. Not quite verified, like no one has seen yours. [SPEAKER_B]: It's true. [SPEAKER_E]: That's all I'm saying. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: So why would you lie to verify me if you don't? [SPEAKER_B]: I want to win as a townsfolk because I got your seer. [SPEAKER_C]: I think it's Justin. [SPEAKER_E]: I don't. [SPEAKER_D]: Wait, why Explain that logic to me. You want to win as a town because I. [SPEAKER_B]: He's verified. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, yeah. Verify. [SPEAKER_E]: Got it. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. So, I mean, it's possible there's no werewolves, but I think we have to kill. [SPEAKER_E]: We haven't done it yet. [SPEAKER_C]: I think it's possible. There's no one. I guarantee you. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm the hunter. [SPEAKER_E]: I believe you. You've been double verified. [SPEAKER_D]: I guarantee you. [SPEAKER_C]: I think we should vote Justin. Yeah, I think we should vote Justin. [SPEAKER_E]: It's either Justin or it's me or there's no werewolves. I don't think there are werewolves. [SPEAKER_D]: I don't. [SPEAKER_E]: There hasn't been any holes in anyone's story so far. That's been glaring. [SPEAKER_D]: What's up, though? I'm a villager. I slept all night. No alibi. [SPEAKER_E]: I know. [SPEAKER_B]: Alibi. [SPEAKER_E]: Sleeping over here. [SPEAKER_C]: That seems like too easy, though. So I think. I think it's Justin, but Alvin's. [SPEAKER_E]: I don't know. [SPEAKER_D]: Just the way you're coming on is strong and confident. [SPEAKER_E]: What is my confidence? [SPEAKER_B]: Well, like, I think there's no. I think. I think we're all villagers. I think we're all on the side of the village. [SPEAKER_E]: We have an opportunity here to all win. [SPEAKER_B]: Let's all vote to our left. [SPEAKER_E]: I'll vote to you. [SPEAKER_D]: No, it's Mitch. [SPEAKER_B]: I think we should all vote to our left. [SPEAKER_D]: No, it's Mitch. [SPEAKER_B]: But you get a vote for Mitch. [SPEAKER_E]: This way. [SPEAKER_B]: Let's all vote to our left. [SPEAKER_D]: No, it's Mitch. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. No, no. [SPEAKER_B]: We have like. [SPEAKER_E]: Fuck you three. No, you can't talk after the tire. [SPEAKER_D]: Fine.

Yeah, I just wanted to be like, one of you won't wake up tomorrow. [SPEAKER_B]: Wake up. [SPEAKER_A]: All right. [SPEAKER_D]: How's everyone feeling? [SPEAKER_A]: Wow. [SPEAKER_D]: Something interesting happened that night. I could tell you that. [SPEAKER_A]: Why do you say that? [SPEAKER_C]: I have a question. Was anyone the drunk? I know I wasn't the drunk. Was anyone the drunk? [SPEAKER_A]: I want to hear. [SPEAKER_D]: Mitchell was the drunk. [SPEAKER_A]: I want to hear Mitchell's first. [SPEAKER_D]: So you must be the seer. I was the robber. So then you ended up with the drunk card, and so I had the robber. I thought I was. [SPEAKER_A]: Did anyone do anything to James? [SPEAKER_D]: So you were the robber and then you switched it with something else. [SPEAKER_A]: Else. [SPEAKER_D]: So you could be the werewolf. You don't even know. [SPEAKER_A]: Did anyone do anything to James? Because I was the seer and he had a werewolf card. 100% confirmed. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, well, I'm gonna back that and just let you guys know. If anyone was a drunk that was a werewolf, we should kill them. [SPEAKER_D]: Wait, who picks first? So like, the robber goes. And then the sear goes before the. [SPEAKER_A]: Robber and then the drunk goes last. [SPEAKER_C]: So did anyone do anything to me? [SPEAKER_A]: Yes. [SPEAKER_C]: Because I guarantee you, as a werewolf, my first play was to look at this card. Werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, God. [SPEAKER_C]: So if these cards are moved, there's werewolves out there. [SPEAKER_D]: Justin, did you move any of them? [SPEAKER_A]: No, I looked at James's card and it was. [SPEAKER_C]: And you're just like. [SPEAKER_A]: Oh, fuck. [SPEAKER_D]: Because I. I, like, corroborated Mitchell's story before he even said anything about it. [SPEAKER_A]: I will stand by this. Yeah, I mean, like, if I'm a werewolf and I'm trying to work with James and I together, I'm doing a poor job. So if we vote for James, because I have no way to switch the card, I'm coming here as a seer. He could be a drunk. [SPEAKER_D]: Which ones did you look at again? [SPEAKER_A]: I looked at just his card. [SPEAKER_D]: Just his card? [SPEAKER_A]: Yes. [SPEAKER_D]: And. What? And I said it was a. I don't. [SPEAKER_C]: I Suddenly don't think you're a seer. [SPEAKER_D]: Did his said werewolf? [SPEAKER_A]: He said werewolf? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: What are they? Both werewolves. [SPEAKER_A]: Well, then if we vote for James, which I will vote along with, then villagers would win. Then villagers would win. [SPEAKER_D]: Which makes me think maybe Justin is the werewolf. What? [SPEAKER_C]: No. Because he wouldn't throw hate at me. [SPEAKER_A]: If we were both the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: If we. Because we look at each other as werewolves. [SPEAKER_A]: Because I'm telling you that's a werewolf card. You're admitting you know you're a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: And you're admitting you know where the other werewolf is. [SPEAKER_A]: And look at it like this. If James and I were the werewolf and we went to a vote, him and I would need to, like, cooperate on a 50. 50 chance of who we were gonna vote with in unison to make it so that we would tie the vote. So there'd be no point in how we tie vote the. If I think it's we part our ways and I think everyone dies. I think I'm tie. [SPEAKER_C]: Like no one wins. [SPEAKER_A]: What the fuck are you virgin losers playing? Oh, Reverie 69. I like the 69 case of a tie. All players tied with the most votes die and reveal their cards. [SPEAKER_C]: I. I really put myself up in a poor position here by admitting I'm the werewolf and knowing that the werewolf. And I just didn't think that through at all. [SPEAKER_D]: You thought someone else was. [SPEAKER_C]: I kind of forgot that I would still lose if they killed the other werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: God damn it, James. [SPEAKER_C]: So I was just trying to figure out who would possibly take that card then kill them instead of me. [SPEAKER_D]: But even if they killed them, you lose. I forgot that. [SPEAKER_C]: Can we just do this? [SPEAKER_A]: Vote for change. [SPEAKER_D]: Say we just vote. I don't know. Do you think we should keep talking or. Yeah, I say we just vote on J.

[SPEAKER_A]: I'm opening my eyes just to turn on the webcam slightly. I think all of us. My voice is now very scary. Oh, man. All right. So Mike is a werewolf. Calls it. I'm. I want to just say this perfectly straight, perfectly honest. I can confirm James was a villager at the start. Thank you. That means you are a seer. Or he was a robber. Oh, possibly. Or. Or they're both werewolves. You can't be a Tanner. Let's. But Mitch could also want to die. Well, Mitch hasn't done anything that's suspicious. I'm just saying Mitch could want to die. Mitch just fucking does things without any. Okay, that reasonably, yes, I'm a villager. If I am in fact a villager, this is how Justin would know that. Do we have a seer? The other way. Just throwing it out there. Not trying to be malicious. Is. That's true, but it is malicious. You're literally calling us werewolves. In all fairness, you know, it depends how you feel about that. If it's malicious. Was there a seer? I was a seer. So you're claiming to be a robber? I'm claiming to be a robber. Did you look at anyone's card? I looked at James's card. Was I a villager? You were a villager. So as it stands. But then again, this is the. We just gotta talk. As it stands, Alvin is also, you know, doing what I did a few rounds ago. Yes. I don't like that. I don't like that at all. But then again, he could want that. That's why he could be playing that. So let's not kill him. What if we just kill Mitchell? Yeah, let's go. Mitchell. I literally haven't said anything yet. I'm double werewolf. This is how we're looking. What were you. I was drunk. Okay, so you're a werewolf. Crazy drunk. You're a werewolf now? No, not necessarily, but odds are. I mean, it's two thirds chance. Mitch is a werewolf. I'm thinking Alvin and James are both werewolves. That's rude. We're wearing plaid. Yeah, it's the plaid. Hate. It is. Can anyone verify Justin's story? Yes, I can. That was a very fast. Yes. Well, the reason he can is because the first thing I said was, I can confirm James is a villager. Yep. And Albin confirmed that with his possible seer or werewolf. I can confirm that Justin confirmed me properly. So he was one of these two items, and he's claiming the robbery. But Justin's not. Justin is not. Ooh. Okay, Justin. Okay, if Justin was a seer. Wait, we always forget that a werewolf can look at one here and really narrow it down. Wait, wait, wait. If Justin was a seer, in all fairness, how would I. That's really narrowing it down. Yeah, that's a reach. Okay, well, no. What's. The robber? And he knows you're the villager because he took your car. I know. I'm saying that's what happened. I know. But I'm also. What if. But then what were you before I was the robber? Or like, what was I before? So wait, you're the C.N. yeah. James, I am currently a villager. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You were a robber and you stole someone's werewolf. You're a current werewolf. You didn't. And I just trusted you. How would I know you were a villager, though? Because you just. How would I know you were a villager? I don't know. I just. I suddenly don't trust you. I think it's. The longer this counts. Okay, okay. These motherfuckers are being super quiet on Mitchell. Honestly, I'm trying to see someone put a hole in their story. That's what I'm waiting for. I'm trying to see Mitchell. Okay, let's say there's one werewolf on the board. Let's just play pretend there's one werewolf on the board. It doesn't matter what these fuckers are. And you're fucking drunk. Like, there's a good chance you're either a werewolf or a Tanner, right? Yeah. So if I'm a Tanner, I win the game. If you guys vote me up. If I'm a werewolf. I was actually a robber. Yeah. What? So what did you steal from Michael? That's how I knew you were village. Okay, he just said he's the robber. I am the robber, bitch. No, I'm voting for Albin now because I was the robber at the start of the game. I don't know why, but I suspect J. Justin. I feel like he's doing something tricky. It's these motherfuckers are both werewolves. I'll promise you that. With me on which one? Mitchell. Mitchell. Yeah, sure. Okay. I started off as the drunk. I freely admit that I'm one of these. That's a gamble. If it's this, then I win the game. Everyone else loses. But Alvin just. Elvin just said he was the robber. Yeah, and I've been. I said he was a villager from the start of the game. If I had to place my. If I had to place my bets. I think this is. I think this is how we're standing. Yeah. I'm voting Alvin. No, he changed his name to Rob completely. Fucking listen to me."}

[SPEAKER_B]: No, that was just. No. [SPEAKER_C]: So Justin's trying to find his way out at this point. [SPEAKER_B]: You guys can vote for me. [SPEAKER_C]: I can verify Elvis story. Who can you verify? [SPEAKER_B]: I looked at cards in the middle. [SPEAKER_E]: So how can you verify one person's. [SPEAKER_B]: I can't verify anyone's story. [SPEAKER_E]: You said you could verify one person's. [SPEAKER_B]: No. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, you did. [SPEAKER_B]: No, I didn't. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, you did. Did you not say that? [SPEAKER_B]: No, I said I want to hear anyone else before I start talking. [SPEAKER_E]: But then when we did this, Mitchell. [SPEAKER_B]: Said he verified Alvin's story. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't. I don't remember Justin saying that. I don't think. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, maybe it was you Fist bump Fisk. [SPEAKER_B]: Fiskus. [SPEAKER_E]: I think so. Mitch, if you were this year, what did you see? [SPEAKER_C]: I saw Albin's card. That's the one I. [SPEAKER_B]: You saw a villager? The safest card to see. [SPEAKER_E]: Yes. [SPEAKER_C]: And that's why I was like I'm just gonna hold back here and wait for. [SPEAKER_E]: What did you see in the middle? [SPEAKER_B]: I saw a werewolf and a drunk. [SPEAKER_E]: Show me. [SPEAKER_C]: So then one of those were. We all think that one of those were sitting there. We all think that one of those were sitting there. [SPEAKER_E]: I like Justin's confidence. [SPEAKER_C]: I think Justin is grappling. [SPEAKER_E]: I like Justin for a way out. [SPEAKER_C]: And he's throwing me under the bus right now. [SPEAKER_D]: I think Justin's the werewolf and Mitch is the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: You know, in all fairness, one of us is really good to be the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: I was like, oh, man, the tanner would be great. [SPEAKER_E]: No, this is. I guarantee you this is how it is. I am so confident. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, my God. You are about to lose us the game again. [SPEAKER_E]: No matter what anyone says, my vote is Mitchell. [SPEAKER_D]: I think just. I still stand by Justin werewolf Mitch Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: Can I know why? [SPEAKER_D]: What's that? [SPEAKER_B]: Kind of why me. [SPEAKER_C]: And not just throwing me under the bus right now. And you are being. [SPEAKER_B]: At the Tanner. He'd want to be hung, right? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: And he is being no one. Oh, he's being. He's playing. You're fucking throwing me. I'm with you on this 100. [SPEAKER_C]: The reason he gave no information and claiming the. The seer is because he had no information. He was the goddamn werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. This information right here, you also could. [SPEAKER_D]: Have looked at one of those and you were the werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: It's true. It's true. [SPEAKER_C]: Maybe he saw the other werewolf. Maybe. Actually, even if you saw James and. [SPEAKER_D]: I know James and I have, like, the same. [SPEAKER_C]: I believe both of you. Well, yeah. What? Yeah. You verified your story. I know. I know you're telling the truth. [SPEAKER_D]: Unless James is, like, just. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm not listening to it. I hesitated last time and I fucked the game up. I guarantee you that when we change cards, this is what you. [SPEAKER_B]: I honestly think what's happening is we have no werewolf and Mitch is the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. What if just Justin could be the Tanner by claiming the same role someone else has? Is a great way of getting. [SPEAKER_D]: It's very true. We could still win if we just say they're both the werewolf and then he turns out to be the Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I guarantee you, Alvin. I guarantee you this is how it stands. I'm that confident. [SPEAKER_C]: His gut. [SPEAKER_D]: I think one of them is a Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: So if I was a seer and he was a Tanner, that would be a great opportunity to say. After I said, I'm a seer, he goes, wait, I'm a seer. And then there's suspicion. So that could be an attempt to be a tame. Well, I said mine first. [SPEAKER_B]: In all fairness, a Seer is also a good one. When someone has already claimed something to verify someone else's story, something that I did earlier got me a lot of heat. [SPEAKER_C]: If I was a werewolf, that means that I claimed Seer before I heard what everyone else said. That means I would use. [SPEAKER_D]: He heard what we both said. And then you used me to verify whatever it is. [SPEAKER_E]: They're not both werewolves. Cause they're fighting. So I guarantee you it's Mitchell as a werewolf. And Justin. I don't know what the fuck Justin. [SPEAKER_C]: So work on what you think he is. That fits with that. [SPEAKER_B]: All right, we got to vote right. [SPEAKER_D]: Away for Justin, I think. [SPEAKER_C]: Wow. It's Justin. And he's making you a sucker for it. [SPEAKER_E]: It's initial."}

[SPEAKER_D]: So you might not absent mindedly play with him. Sorry, you might not be who you thought, who you think you are. [SPEAKER_B]: So does anyone want to declare anything? [SPEAKER_C]: Wait, he's someone else. [SPEAKER_B]: First I'm going to say I was the robber. [SPEAKER_C]: But I could take that from you. [SPEAKER_D]: Right, I was the seer. I know one person, what their card was, so do not lie to me. [SPEAKER_C]: But it could have been switched. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, I played my seer role. So I did look at a card. [SPEAKER_B]: Scale saying she's the villager. Dan, did you switch anyone's cards around? [SPEAKER_C]: Yes. [SPEAKER_B]: Who did you switch? [SPEAKER_D]: Maybe wait, wait till Mike. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. Mike. Yeah. What are you? A villager? So we got villager, villager, seer, troublemaker, drawer. So we currently have no werewolves. It is possible to have no werewolves. Dan, who did you switch around? [SPEAKER_C]: Whose card did you take? [SPEAKER_B]: I took the logic of trying to, not just to stay on the side of the village as we said. So I did not switch with anybody. I am still the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: It's possible he switched with someone, looked at the card and it turns out to be a werewolf and now he's trying to play innocent. It's possible. [SPEAKER_B]: Can I know either who you guys like, who you swatch with or who you looked at? [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, I'll just say the person I looked at is being honest right now. I'll start with that. Okay, that's fair. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. I switched Caitlyn and Justin. [SPEAKER_B]: No lie. [SPEAKER_C]: No lie. [SPEAKER_B]: Alright. Caitlin's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: I think that she is a werewolf. No, no, no. [SPEAKER_B]: Caitlyn's a werewolf. I was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: But to be fair, Caitlyn put villager and she could be villager, but I think that she was a werewolf and she didn't know what else to take, so. So she took a village. No, no, no, no. [SPEAKER_B]: You Switched with me. You switched ours? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. No, I was a werewolf and I was doing. [SPEAKER_C]: He's not saying he's a w. He said he's a werewolf and switched with Caitlyn. Yeah, but I'm saying. [SPEAKER_B]: No, no, I can guarantee there was only one werewolf. It was me. If you switch with Caitlyn, she's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: There's not two werewolves. [SPEAKER_B]: There is one in here. [SPEAKER_C]: That's what I'm saying is. I think you're the other werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: No, there was. I'm. I was the werewolf at the start. [SPEAKER_C]: He gets to know what all the other werewolves are. [SPEAKER_B]: Open my eyes. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, okay. [SPEAKER_B]: I was the only one saw robbery. And if you switched us, Caitlyn's the werewolf. Who did you look at? [SPEAKER_D]: I looked at his. [SPEAKER_B]: So what you're saying is true. As a side of the village, she's the werewolf. Because I was the werewolf at the beginning. [SPEAKER_D]: Now, is there any way Justin is messing with us? [SPEAKER_C]: Yes, I think that they're both werewolves and he's just trying to save his ass. [SPEAKER_D]: But if he threw her under the bus and she is a werewolf right now and she gets voted, both werewolves lose. [SPEAKER_B]: Yes. [SPEAKER_D]: So they need. The werewolves need to work together. [SPEAKER_B]: They win or lose as a team. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: The troublemaker happens after the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: But there was no robber. [SPEAKER_B]: Was no robber. Exactly. So it's her. She's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: If what you're saying is true, then yes, that totally makes sense. I'm just trying to see if there's a loophole that you're like. [SPEAKER_C]: So I just exploited what happens if there's two werewolves. We just have to vote out one and. Oh, yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: And if there's no werewolves, we have to be careful to not vote anyone out. [SPEAKER_B]: So if we think there's no werewolves, we just get a tie and then no one. [SPEAKER_C]: Unless he. He saw her card. [SPEAKER_B]: With what? [SPEAKER_C]: With his. Something else. And. [SPEAKER_D]: Maybe he was a robber. [SPEAKER_C]: Maybe he looked at her, he switched. [SPEAKER_D]: With her, he ended up with the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: And then. [SPEAKER_A]: One minute. [SPEAKER_B]: True. No, guys, now he is a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: He knows it. [SPEAKER_C]: But he said that he. You said you picked up a card here. [SPEAKER_B]: I looked at this card. Why would I. Why would I lie at the beginning and change. [SPEAKER_C]: You had to take the card. [SPEAKER_B]: If you. No, you just look at it. No, not as the robber. You can only change with players. As the only werewolf. I looked here, saw Rob. [SPEAKER_C]: You know what I think? I think that Justin checks out, and I think we should. I think. [SPEAKER_B]: I agree. [SPEAKER_C]: She hasn't said a thing, so. Well, she's obsessed with jerk. All right, so that sounded werewolfies to me. [SPEAKER_B]: Whenever it starts counting and when it says 3, 3, 2, 1, you have to vote immediately. You vote by pointing. You can't wait for other people to vote. That's. [SPEAKER_C]: And then the majority wins. [SPEAKER_B]: Yes. So let's stop and vote. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay."}

All right. Troublemaker. Yeah. So then. So he's Dan. You can call out, Dan, what were you. It's all up to you, Dan. What was he? Did I get switched? Yeah. What were you? Oh, I was a villager. Wow. All our alibis, do they check out. But a werewolf could have thrown a wrench in the hammer at any point in that long chain of events. So let's go through it in the night. Okay, so at the start, this is what we all are saying we were. Yes. Correct. So then Seer. Seer, yes. Looked. I looked at Mitchell. He was a villager. Saw a villager. And I confirmed he's a seer because I was confident that I am truly robbery. You switch with me? Nope. No, I switched with Mitchell and then Troublemaker. I think it was Professor Plum in the library with the candlestick. Guys, I think we work together so well without any hesitation. I feel like we all just need to vote. Left. I'm with you. And if werewolves win this round, they're amazing. You're like the best werewolves you fucking just. Just outplay. Yeah. Should we do this? Wait, Dan, do you agree? So everyone vote to your left. Yes. And that ties it up. [SPEAKER_A]: Time is up, everyone."}

Okay. You switched two people. I did. Who did you switch? I'm not gonna say I was a robber and I switched with a villager, but that I'm at a point where that looks a little suspicious. Which one did you switch with? Why were you lying? I'm just wondering. Okay, I'll. I'll. I'll. I switch these two. Which way did you rob from? Were you. I feel like you were lying then. Justin, I want. There are three villagers here. I'm just trying to figure out. I. I switched with a villager. I'm reluctant to give up that info. Yeah, I think he's the werewolf. Dan, now that we've been switched, were you honestly a villager? Yeah, I was a villager. Here's what we need to know, Mitch. Did you steal from me? I feel like you are being honest. I would feel the same. Did you steal from me? What were you actually. I was a werewolf. Did you steal from me? No, I did not. I just switched with Kaylin. You stole Caitlyn's. Yeah. And you were both villagers? No, I was a robber. She's a villager. And I can. I can confirm she was a villager, and I switched with her. And you switched these two? No, I actually switched these two. Justin's a werewolf? Could be. I'm willing to buy that. Were you actually a villager? I was actually a villager. If I was lying. So you stole from her, and then I switched them back. So you are still a robber? Actually, are you a robber? I smell started a robber, and I ended up. I think Justin's a werewolf. I'd agree with that. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay, time is up, everyone. Three."}

Us three again. Withholding information, huh? It's always us three waiting to the end. Because Dan and I don't get to play anything for fun. Yeah, but you guys can be careful. What if you got switched for a werewolf? Well, if you're honest right off the bat, then. No, wait, you might be a werewolf now. You might have been switched, right? No. No. For my logic though, you always put what you were right at the beginning out there. If you don't care, do I care if anyone. Did somebody switch me? Did everybody switch? Dan, I revealed first when it was you. Me this time. So I would like you to reveal first this time. I'm gonna be brave. Say I am the third villager out there. It's not brave. It's brave because it looks suspicious. I can confirm that one of these three stories are true. What? Just one? Oh, I guess you only looked at one. So what are you? What are you? Seer or robber? Seer or robber? Yes, Mike. You. You want to reveal any information? Mike's a werewolf. No. Even a little bit? No. I've always held off my troublemaker. Who did you switch? We might all be good again. Maybe this. This round's far too suspicious. Now, are you actually a villager? Yes. Are you sure? Yes. Okay. Did you switch anybody? I did. Who did you switch? I switched these two. Woo. Okay, now, out of the three of us, myself included, we could have been a werewolf, looked at a card, saw a villager, and claimed I can confirm that one of these two is a villager. I'm probably still a villager. Can anyone verify? Troublemaker. So are you a villager now then? Yes. Okay, so Caitlyn and Justin were like. Justin confirmed that Caitlyn was the villager. I think I can find that one of these two. Yeah. Oh, he switched. So it's not steer, it's robber. And he switched with one of you two. Yeah, yeah. What you're saying. Okay. There was hesitation in that voice. Well, just because I was like, did I confirm that? But yes, I did. Because I said, I am now a villager. I did. Yeah. And you switched us. Like you. I switched these two, and you are a villager. I started as a villager. Okay. I was actually the seer, and Mike is a werewolf. Okay. So here we are. That's a big. Either of them can be a werewolf and be playing this position that they're in. That was late coming to the game on that, but I'll buy it. The look on his face. I'm willing to go for that. So, Mike, defend yourself, man. I. I've already defended myself. I've switched these two. Mike's the werewolf, man. If what you see. But I. But here's what I'm getting from. He was waiting for Justin to not say he was the seer. I got my troublemaker from the beginning. Well, I was waiting to see Dan played. He was a snake in the grass, and he was a good snake. You did good. You waited to see everyone else's story. I was trying to see if you were, in fact, the troublemaker, just to prove. So I'd have you being the robber and you being the troublemaker on my boat, that he is the werewolf and he's not the troublemaker. He's lying. If you lie to me, I'm gonna be really mad. Dan did claim that you took my card because he knew he wasn't a villager. That's why I did that. Yes, that's true. [SPEAKER_B]: One minute remaining. [SPEAKER_A]: That's also why I paused there, because I was like, yeah, I'm good to go to a vote. Mitch might be good, too. Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Time is up, everyone. Three, two."}

[SPEAKER_C]: First, I will say I was not a villager. I'll start with that. I was a. [SPEAKER_D]: Dan. What about you? [SPEAKER_C]: Which one do I need? [SPEAKER_B]: Do you want me to put them in a cup and, like, you can pick one out? K. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: There's new meta here. Or Dan doesn't understand what the Tanner does. [SPEAKER_C]: Did I fuck up? No, no. [SPEAKER_D]: I wanted. I'm gonna. I was the seer. I looked at two cards in the center, and they were both villagers. [SPEAKER_B]: So there's definitely at least one werewolf out there. [SPEAKER_C]: I will say that someone, one of you four, is claiming to have the position. I was. [SPEAKER_B]: Robert. [SPEAKER_C]: No, no, I'm saying I'm one of these four. [SPEAKER_D]: So then you were the robber. [SPEAKER_C]: No, no. [SPEAKER_B]: So how do you say I started? [SPEAKER_C]: One of you is lying. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, so you still are one of those people? [SPEAKER_C]: Yes, I believe I am. Who's lying to these people? I don't want to give that up yet. I want the liar to. [SPEAKER_D]: The lie's not gonna come forward. [SPEAKER_C]: No, but I want. We gotta figure it out. [SPEAKER_E]: Justin. Who'd you look at? [SPEAKER_D]: I looked at two cards in the center, and there were two villagers. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, then. [SPEAKER_D]: Which is suspicious. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, this is what I think happened then. Mitch was the seer. Justin was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Nope. I was the seer from the beginning. I looked at two guys in the center. There's. There was two villagers. I promise you that. [SPEAKER_B]: Justin was the werewolf. And I'm gonna fuck things up. I switch these two. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, Justin's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: That's not possible. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you start as a werewolf? [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, Justin's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: So if he wasn't before, he is now. [SPEAKER_E]: He is now. [SPEAKER_D]: Mitch. How do you know someone's lying? [SPEAKER_B]: What if there's two. There's two werewolves. What if there's two werewolves and it's Mitch and Justin? [SPEAKER_E]: Justin's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: So Justin's still saying he was a. [SPEAKER_D]: Seer at the beginning. I was. [SPEAKER_B]: So then I definitely switch these two. What is the order of everything? [SPEAKER_D]: It goes werewolves, seer, robber, troublemaker. [SPEAKER_E]: Justin, who'd you look at? [SPEAKER_D]: I looked at two in the center. [SPEAKER_E]: Why do I keep asking you that question? [SPEAKER_D]: And they were like this. What was it again? Doing this. Oh, the order. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, okay. [SPEAKER_C]: Who is that? [SPEAKER_B]: I think you're being a troll. [SPEAKER_D]: Werewolf, seer, robber, troublemaker. Okay, Mitch. [SPEAKER_E]: Mitch, what were you. [SPEAKER_D]: Can you confirm Mike's story? [SPEAKER_C]: I was lying about someone taking my position. [SPEAKER_D]: Great, great. [SPEAKER_B]: So you were werewolf. I think it's you two. [SPEAKER_C]: It's werewolves. [SPEAKER_D]: But what if Mitch stole from me and now he's the werewolf? [SPEAKER_B]: He was the robber. And you're saying now you're the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: And he's the werewolf? [SPEAKER_B]: No, but I swear, no, Robert, robber went first. [SPEAKER_D]: That's true. [SPEAKER_B]: So you're still the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: That's technically yes. That would be how it goes. But I like that confirms Caitlyn saying a villager earlier, because that was a lie. And if she's open about being a werewolf now. [SPEAKER_C]: I was the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: Who did you steal from? [SPEAKER_C]: I stole from Dan. [SPEAKER_D]: So now you're the Tanner? [SPEAKER_E]: Maybe, yes. [SPEAKER_D]: Or is he also a werewolf? [SPEAKER_E]: Well, I can. Can I confirm something? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: I looked at bat. Justin's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, you looked at that. [SPEAKER_C]: Dan wasn't being honest. [SPEAKER_D]: Dan wasn't being honest.

[SPEAKER_C]: It away, but did anyone else open their eyes? [SPEAKER_E]: No, nobody saw me. [SPEAKER_D]: It's like a whole new role. [SPEAKER_F]: Dan, I'm just pausing this because this. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I'm not answering your question because it might give away. No, I was gonna say. Can I. I'd rather not restart the game because that's. That's blooney. But if I just not say anything about what I saw and pretend I didn't see anything. Can we just continue? [SPEAKER_D]: I say we use it as a role. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: I use the option. [SPEAKER_C]: I think it should be public knowledge now. Which round was it? And. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah, okay. Was it the werewolf? [SPEAKER_E]: Seriously? Yeah. [SPEAKER_F]: We're not playing the game. [SPEAKER_E]: It was not the werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: Then I think that's what matters most. The werewolf is the hardest. What. What position was it? What? Which one was it? [SPEAKER_E]: You want to know which one it was? [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Um. He doesn't remember. [SPEAKER_F]: Well, if you don't remember, Seer, Robert or Troublemaker. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, it was Troublemaker. [SPEAKER_F]: Okay. All right, let's keep going. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. [SPEAKER_F]: What did you do? Who did you switch? Let's wait. All right, that's fair. [SPEAKER_B]: Everybody else gets to play this game. [SPEAKER_C]: I want to play. [SPEAKER_E]: Just. Just so you know, I don't know what you did. [SPEAKER_C]: Who'd you like? [SPEAKER_E]: I just saw you, like, move, and I was like, oh, fuck. Why did you open up my eyes? [SPEAKER_F]: I saw two villagers. [SPEAKER_C]: Two villagers. [SPEAKER_B]: That's fine. Mike's. I had to slide over. My foot keeps touching me. [SPEAKER_D]: That means that there has to be a werewolf in play. [SPEAKER_F]: Yep. [SPEAKER_D]: If you're speaking the truth. Or Justin's a werewolf and he saw a seer. Nope. Because it's pretty bold to say there's two villagers there. [SPEAKER_F]: Not at all. Because there are two villagers there. [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_D]: If you're a werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: But I'm not. [SPEAKER_D]: It would be bold. So I'm saying you're not a werewolf. You're probably a seer. So that's probably honest. [SPEAKER_E]: That's probably true. Except for the fact that I was actually the seer and that this is a villager and this is a robber. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, so why would Justin lie? He could be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Or Dan's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_F]: Kaylan, who did you. [SPEAKER_D]: What are you guys. [SPEAKER_F]: You guys talk? [SPEAKER_D]: Justin claims Cyr. [SPEAKER_C]: First move, and then someone else claims it. [SPEAKER_E]: But what's a negative strategy? [SPEAKER_B]: Mike, tell me the order again. [SPEAKER_F]: Cyr robber, troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: Mike, who are you? [SPEAKER_E]: Robber didn't go. Like, I can tell you that. If she is the troublemaker and I'm the seer, that's the only stuff that happened there. [SPEAKER_F]: Oh, yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: So the rest are werewolves. Like, this is villager. This is robber. For sure. 100%. [SPEAKER_D]: I suspect we have a tanner, you know. [SPEAKER_C]: Ooh, that's a bold move. [SPEAKER_E]: Could be. That was a good strategy. [SPEAKER_D]: He took the strategy that Mike said to do. As a Tanner, claim seer right off the bat. Or as the werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: I saw a seer in here. Or werewolf, and then I was like two villagers. [SPEAKER_D]: But only a Tanner would say, maybe. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, but no, they're. Oh, yeah, I guess so. [SPEAKER_B]: But you wouldn't see a seer if Dan's telling the truth. [SPEAKER_F]: Dan's not telling the truth. Dan's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: I. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I am telling the truth. [SPEAKER_C]: No, I'll confirm Dan's story. [SPEAKER_F]: I'll also confirm my story. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm gonna put it there. [SPEAKER_E]: What are you? Werewolf. Werewolf. And Tanner? [SPEAKER_D]: Werewolf or a villager? I'm double werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Who did you switch? [SPEAKER_B]: These two. [SPEAKER_D]: You and I. [SPEAKER_F]: Double werewolf. Double werewolf. You just switched the two werewolves. [SPEAKER_E]: So Justin's perspective. If he was the tanner, it will not change, because now he's the werewolf and still wants to be voted out. No, he doesn't want to be voted out. [SPEAKER_F]: 15%. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, yeah. No, never mind. It will change. Or. Yeah, hit. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. Or whatever it is. [SPEAKER_B]: So if I switch them and we think Justin's the Tanner, we should vote. [SPEAKER_C]: Justin out, because now Mitch is the tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, now Mitch is the tanner. Then if that's true. [SPEAKER_F]: Mitch, were you aware. [SPEAKER_D]: So only if you switched us. Only I know what Justin is. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah, and I know what Mitchell is because Mitch was two villagers. [SPEAKER_C]: No, I think it. [SPEAKER_E]: Seem. If Mitch. [SPEAKER_C]: I think I know. I think. I think Justin was the werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: What if they're both werewolves, though? [SPEAKER_C]: It's. [SPEAKER_E]: It's true, too. [SPEAKER_C]: But then they wouldn't be, because Mitch. [SPEAKER_E]: Would be in a real predicament right now. Either way, if the tanner or the werewolf thing. Because either he just. Okay. It's so complicated. If Justin was. You switched these two. [SPEAKER_B]: I switched those two. [SPEAKER_D]: Maybe it's Mike. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah, there's a lot of fingers being pointed. Mitch and I. When Mitch and I are both villagers. [SPEAKER_C]: I think he. I think he was the werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: And now. [SPEAKER_A]: 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_E]: That is not true. This is a villager. You're not a villager. Justin. [SPEAKER_C]: I think Justin's now the werewolf. No, wait. [SPEAKER_E]: No. He's just distracting us. [SPEAKER_D]: This is so funny. [SPEAKER_C]: We're gonna. It's. We're gonna vote here. [SPEAKER_E]: Who do you think is the werewolf? Mitch. [SPEAKER_B]: Mitch was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Time is up, everyone."}

So this is the drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: Now he's a lone werewolf, but he doesn't know. [SPEAKER_B]: He doesn't know what he is. [SPEAKER_E]: All right, no, but I think he started as a lone werewolf, and then he looked at the car. [SPEAKER_D]: What are you guys. [SPEAKER_B]: No. [SPEAKER_E]: You guys are awfully suspicious up there. [SPEAKER_C]: Are you actually a villager? [SPEAKER_B]: I'm actually a villager. 100%. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm 100%.

This is Also a villager. [SPEAKER_B]: Sweet. [SPEAKER_C]: So I know what both of these are right here. [SPEAKER_B]: How do you know what both of those are? [SPEAKER_C]: What are you guys? Because Justin was lying about who he was at the beginning. [SPEAKER_B]: And I confirmed that by being the villager. [SPEAKER_E]: I can confirm that one of you guys is lying because I was that chip. I was that character. [SPEAKER_D]: I can confirm that someone at this table is telling the truth. [SPEAKER_B]: No, you can't. Is it you? [SPEAKER_D]: I can. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, it's you. Who'd you steal from Justin? [SPEAKER_D]: I wanna know what you are. [SPEAKER_E]: We just settle it. [SPEAKER_B]: Who'd you steal from? [SPEAKER_D]: I need to know more from you guys. [SPEAKER_E]: If Justin stole from me. Nevermind. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't think he did. I think he stole from either Mike. [SPEAKER_E]: Or I. I was a Tanner and I think Justin stole from me and he doesn't want to admit it. [SPEAKER_B]: I can agree with that. That means Caitlyn's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Then let's try to find who the werewolf is. [SPEAKER_B]: That means Caitlyn's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, we don't know what this one is, but it's obviously. If we're all telling this correctly, then those are the two werewolves and Caitlyn's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Still burping? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, they were potent. Those. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm Justin. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm gonna vote. [SPEAKER_E]: You need to come clean on who you switched with because it wasn't me. [SPEAKER_D]: Why'd he say that? [SPEAKER_B]: You think he switched with Caitlyn? I know he's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: He did not switch with me. [SPEAKER_B]: How do you know? [SPEAKER_C]: He did try to fuck himself loyally. [SPEAKER_D]: If you tell me. Why? [SPEAKER_E]: Because I. I said I was the Tanner and we switched. If that was true, you would have been like Mitchell. You were not the Tanner when you started. Oh, I. I was not the Tanner when I started. [SPEAKER_D]: Nice. What are you. Are you the drunk? [SPEAKER_E]: I think Justin is a liar. And I think Justin is who we need to vote for. [SPEAKER_C]: It's true. [SPEAKER_A]: One minute remaining. [SPEAKER_C]: Did anybody switch? Me? [SPEAKER_D]: I did. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh my God. He's the Tanner. No, he's the Tanner. He didn't switch anybody. He's been the Tanner the whole fucking time. [SPEAKER_D]: You looked at Mike? Well, you looked at these two, right? You looked at these two. [SPEAKER_C]: I didn't look at any. [SPEAKER_B]: No, he. [SPEAKER_D]: What did you look at? [SPEAKER_C]: He's not. I was the villager. [SPEAKER_E]: I think. Okay, maybe Dan's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't think Dan's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Dan's not the werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: Convinced. [SPEAKER_E]: You guys are very confident now. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't know who is. [SPEAKER_A]: Only 30 seconds. [SPEAKER_E]: I think we have two. And I think it's Justin. [SPEAKER_B]: You're not the seer because you're wrong. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I am the seer. [SPEAKER_C]: No, I am the seer. I was kidding again. [SPEAKER_D]: And I was the robber, and I switched with you. I promise. Okay, you've been saying switching with a lot of people. [SPEAKER_E]: I think I'm voting. [SPEAKER_C]: I agree with that. Because he. Mitch, hadn't said anything that he done that he. That he done. And Justin said that one of us. [SPEAKER_B]: There's two werewolves out there. It doesn't matter which one of those two is a werewolf. Caitlin's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Time is up, everyone. Three."}

Neither of you guys are just accepting being werewolves. That's it. [SPEAKER_A]: That's life, right, Dan? [SPEAKER_E]: And you guys are. We got two villagers, we got two. [SPEAKER_D]: Werewolves and a robber. This is an awful night. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, this was a weird night. We all woke up and I'm like, I fucking stole something this night. And you guys are like, we are werewolves. [SPEAKER_A]: So was there anyone in particular? [SPEAKER_D]: Werewolf walking down the street, Scratch and brushing his teeth? [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: What's up? [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: So there's no other. There's no powers? Other powers except for the robber? Is that what we're saying? [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: So, Mitch, can you just confirm if any of us are lying? [SPEAKER_E]: I'm not gonna do that. [SPEAKER_A]: That's fair. [SPEAKER_E]: That's reasonable. [SPEAKER_A]: He's a werewolf because I was the robber. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, I know Justin's lying now. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: But he's probably. [SPEAKER_D]: He's probably the seer. [SPEAKER_A]: Dan, what were you. You, like, literally haven't said anything? [SPEAKER_B]: No, I'm trying a new strategy of just silence. [SPEAKER_E]: It's working. [SPEAKER_B]: I just. I'm afraid to come up with what I am just because I feel one person here is not who they say they are. [SPEAKER_D]: Is it either these two. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm not gonna say until. Just comes clean. [SPEAKER_A]: I'll just say come clean. He's a robber. And I. I'm not. I wasn't. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, no, no. I don't mean come clean without who he is about like what he had before. [SPEAKER_A]: No, man. You got to just say, right. We have literally no information here. Right now, the werewolves are winning. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, it's true. [SPEAKER_A]: Like, right now, the werewolves are winning. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, because fingers aren't being pointed anywhere. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Mike, you want to come clean? [SPEAKER_A]: No. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm a villager. [SPEAKER_A]: Guys, this is killer. I had no power that was useful to discerning information. So I'm either the Tanner or the drunk. Yeah, and we need to know something. [SPEAKER_D]: But you're on our team, so I don't think you're the Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: If he's. If he was a drunk, he's a liability, and if he's a Tanner, he's a liability in the opposite way. We can't vote for him. But if he's drunk, then we probably do want to vote for him. [SPEAKER_A]: Guys, we have a minute and 50 seconds. [SPEAKER_E]: It's possible they were both werewolves, and they're just like. We're villagers. [SPEAKER_A]: Dan, we need you. We have a minute and 45 seconds. [SPEAKER_B]: I was the seer. [SPEAKER_A]: Did you look at people's cards, or did you look in the center? [SPEAKER_B]: I looked in the center. [SPEAKER_A]: What did you see? [SPEAKER_B]: I'll tell one thing. I saw that there was a werewolf here and a werewolf here. [SPEAKER_D]: Dan's a werewolf. Whoa. [SPEAKER_E]: If he's telling the truth, then we're all in the clear. Except for possibly drunk. [SPEAKER_A]: Who did you switch with? [SPEAKER_E]: I didn't switch with anyone. [SPEAKER_B]: Were you actually the drunk? [SPEAKER_A]: No, I was the Tanner. Now I feel like I'm. You guys aren't going to vote for me? [SPEAKER_D]: Who do you switch with? You just not switch. [SPEAKER_E]: I didn't switch with any. [SPEAKER_D]: But you are the robber. [SPEAKER_E]: I am the robbery. I. Holy fuck. [SPEAKER_A]: With 50 seconds. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. Anyone could be a werewolf at this table. I don't trust anyone. My best guess is we're all innocent and werewolves are doing really well. [SPEAKER_D]: If the. If the. If we. If we vote somebody out from the village, do we lose? [SPEAKER_A]: If there's a werewolf, yes. [SPEAKER_E]: So if Dan was telling the truth, we're all good. If Dan's lying, he's a werewolf, so it's all on Dan's shoulders. [SPEAKER_D]: So let's just all vote for Dan. [SPEAKER_E]: No, but if he's good, then we all lose. If he's telling the truth. [SPEAKER_D]: No, no, we don't lose. Only if there was werewolves. [SPEAKER_A]: No, if we kill. If we kill an innocent, we all. The werewolves win. [SPEAKER_B]: Yes, but. [SPEAKER_D]: No, but what if there was no werewolves? [SPEAKER_E]: I believe we lose. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, only if it's a. I, I. I don't think Justin. [SPEAKER_A]: I think Justin was the drunk. I trust. [SPEAKER_E]: I trust Stan, and I think we're all good. That's my opinion. [SPEAKER_D]: He wouldn't put the Tanner down. Time is up. Everyone, like, no, you can't talk."}

You don't get to see, so that could be a boring steal. Well, I didn't steal the seer. Okay. Do you steal a villager? I saw villager. Did you steal from me? I stole your villager. Yeah.

Mike, what's happening with you? I guarantee you I'm not the werewolf. Where are you and why are you? I am the villager. You're not the villager. Villager. I think I grabbed a villager.

[SPEAKER_C]: Why would they both be werewolves? [SPEAKER_A]: Because you guys are corroborating. Corroborating. Corroborating each other's stories. [SPEAKER_D]: No, James didn't believe me from the beginning. [SPEAKER_C]: I think he's the tanner. He's trying to cast suspicion on himself. [SPEAKER_D]: I don't see how me switching with a villager cast suspicion on myself. [SPEAKER_C]: Everyone switches with the villager. Everyone wants the life where you just. You fucking just get by. You do. You put in your eight. You get by. Comfor. [SPEAKER_A]: What if we don't have werewolves? [SPEAKER_C]: What if we don't have werewolves? [SPEAKER_A]: What if I was this. [SPEAKER_D]: Were you yourself when you woke up? [SPEAKER_A]: I can confirm I was myself when I woke up. I still feel like Justin. [SPEAKER_D]: I'll vote. To the left. [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_A]: Why not? [SPEAKER_C]: Because there's a werewolf out there. It's Mitchell. [SPEAKER_E]: I also suspect there's a werewolf out there. [SPEAKER_A]: Who do you suspect it's Mitchell? [SPEAKER_E]: It's not me. [SPEAKER_C]: It's Mitchell. [SPEAKER_E]: I think it's Mike. [SPEAKER_C]: I think it's Mitchell. I don't think Mike was a robber at all. [SPEAKER_A]: So you're saying it's Mike? [SPEAKER_C]: No, I just. I don't think you were the insomniac. I don't buy anybody's story but mine. [SPEAKER_A]: As a villager, I'm now trying. Because we have a minute and ten seconds. I want to figure out I was an insomniac. I need other villagers to come and talk to me about being on the village team. [SPEAKER_C]: I was a villager. [SPEAKER_D]: I was a villager. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, the village team. [SPEAKER_D]: The village team. [SPEAKER_C]: I. [SPEAKER_B]: One minute remaining suspect. [SPEAKER_C]: Mitchell or Mike? Kind of. [SPEAKER_A]: Why? [SPEAKER_C]: Because Mike just. I don't promise. [SPEAKER_A]: I haven't heard either of them try to emotionally manipulate us, but I think I also. [SPEAKER_C]: You're talky, so I kind of think you might be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: I think you're onto something, James. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, now you're agreeing with me. That always makes me suspicious because you manipulate me. Like going with my gut. I'm holding Mike. [SPEAKER_B]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_C]: Thanks, pal. [SPEAKER_D]: I mean, Mitch is maybe trying to push people away from voting for him by showing he's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: Dan, you'd want to be going down in a blaze of glory, especially when there's no werewolves. You want to start making suspicions. So why are you not talking like the Tanner? In all fairness. In all fairness. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm just saying I'm part of the village team. I just don't want. [SPEAKER_A]: In all fairness, you. Why are you not. [SPEAKER_B]: Time is up.

[SPEAKER_C]: I think he's the Tanner. Well. [SPEAKER_A]: Well, you actually robbed before me, so I feel like you should tell me who you robbed first. [SPEAKER_C]: No, I need. I want to know who you trouble, cuz. [SPEAKER_A]: No. No, I'm. I'm not. You were before me. You can now make up any sort of bullshit. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm not making up any question. [SPEAKER_A]: Can you tell us now what you were when you woke up? [SPEAKER_E]: No. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay. [SPEAKER_E]: I don't want to. [SPEAKER_C]: I think he's now the werewolf. I think you switched us two. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm pretty confident I'm no longer a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: You switched us too. [SPEAKER_E]: So you were a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Can I just ask, did you rob? [SPEAKER_C]: I did. [SPEAKER_D]: I started as a werewolf. That's a bold statement. [SPEAKER_C]: I did not rock. Did you switch us too? [SPEAKER_A]: I switched these two. So then he might be the werewolf? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, he's a fucking werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: No, you fucker. [SPEAKER_D]: No, no. I want to vote for you, not me. [SPEAKER_A]: So you actually were the werewolf? [SPEAKER_D]: I started as the werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: I don't believe him for a second. That's suspicious. [SPEAKER_D]: That's the least suspicious thing. [SPEAKER_A]: And you stole from him? [SPEAKER_C]: No, I stole from you. [SPEAKER_A]: You stole from me. Can you back up my story? [SPEAKER_C]: Yes. [SPEAKER_D]: That he's a troublemaker? [SPEAKER_C]: Yes. [SPEAKER_E]: So right now? Yeah, flip it. [SPEAKER_C]: That doesn't really matter. [SPEAKER_A]: And were you at the beginning, Mitchell? [SPEAKER_D]: I was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Right. So now you're the insomniac. So does this. Does this story check out for everybody? [SPEAKER_E]: No. [SPEAKER_D]: So James would know. [SPEAKER_E]: I think it's Mitchell, but. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, but Justin Swift. Okay, I really trust the story up until the point of that. I was not a werewolf. I was a Tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: You were. [SPEAKER_D]: I was. I was a Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: So. I thought so. [SPEAKER_D]: And now. And now I'm starting to back away from saying werewolf, because now we're starting to put suspicion on him. [SPEAKER_B]: So then, one minute remaining. [SPEAKER_A]: What were you at the start? The insomniac. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: And you're the Tanner now. [SPEAKER_E]: I don't want to say. [SPEAKER_A]: Should we then just vote to our left? Because if we vote to our left, James loses. Mm. Unless he opens his mouth and, you. [SPEAKER_C]: Know, unless he wants to vote for whoever but left, it's still Mitchell Nobody. [SPEAKER_A]: If someone else is hung, he loses. It needs to be him. [SPEAKER_E]: Someone else is hung. [SPEAKER_A]: Like if another villager is hung. You lose if you're the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: The only way for you to win if you're a Tanner is to die. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I just. [SPEAKER_B]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_E]: Mitch is bullshitting, and I am the werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: I think I'll take the chance on us losing than you winning. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh man. [SPEAKER_A]: Cuz I don't think Mitch was a village. I think he would. He wouldn't lie about you being a. [SPEAKER_E]: Werewolf because it could be double werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: To the left. [SPEAKER_A]: It could be double werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: So both of them would be werewolves, you're saying? [SPEAKER_A]: That's a possibility? [SPEAKER_B]: Time is up.

Me. No, you're a liar. Who did you switch? You and Mitchell. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, I see. I see what happened. I fucking see exactly what happened. [SPEAKER_A]: Oh, my God. [SPEAKER_C]: What? [SPEAKER_D]: You idiots. [SPEAKER_A]: What were you. Did you steal. [SPEAKER_C]: I'll reveal one of them. [SPEAKER_A]: So you stole from. [SPEAKER_D]: There are two werewolves in the middle. [SPEAKER_A]: You stole from. You stole from Justin. I switched it back. Were you. This. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, I don't know where the confusion is coming from. [SPEAKER_D]: I just gotta think of what I need to. What I want to give out there. [SPEAKER_A]: Can I parlay what I think? [SPEAKER_D]: Which one of you was actually the troublemaker? [SPEAKER_A]: I was. I was. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. [SPEAKER_A]: I was. I was. I was. [SPEAKER_C]: One of them's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: Yes, that's exactly what's happening. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you have the Tanner? [SPEAKER_D]: I had the Tanner at one point. [SPEAKER_C]: And now you don't. [SPEAKER_D]: Now I do not. Well, I don't know. I don't. I do not think I do. [SPEAKER_C]: One of them was the Tanner. One of them is now the Tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: Did you switch you and Mitch? [SPEAKER_C]: One of them was the insomniac and then looked and they're now the Tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: Did you steal from me? And then we switch back. [SPEAKER_D]: There's a Tanner out there, Mike. [SPEAKER_C]: There's a Tanner. There's a Tanner out there. [SPEAKER_D]: And that Tanner is trying to also pretend to be the troublemaker. So the question is, which one of these is the Tanner? [SPEAKER_A]: So we have no werewolves? Is that what we're saying? We're gonna just let Mike, I do. [SPEAKER_D]: Not believe there's a werewolf out there. [SPEAKER_A]: Why would you hold that information back, though, if you were the seer? [SPEAKER_C]: I was seeing if someone was gonna lie. [SPEAKER_A]: But that's the thing. [SPEAKER_D]: But no one would because the werewolves are gone. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, I wanted to see if someone was gonna be the tanner and say, I'm the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Now, he could might be a werewolf and he looked at one and he saw a werewolf, and now he's just saying or he saw the seer. [SPEAKER_A]: I just. I just hate. I just hate the plays where, like, someone like a seer with that information would h. I wanted to know if. [SPEAKER_C]: There was a Tanner out there. [SPEAKER_D]: But then, you know, I'm. Yeah, I'm. [SPEAKER_A]: It happens naturally. Where it happens naturally. When that happens. When you say, as a villager, I see two werewolves, then the tanner's like, nope. [SPEAKER_D]: Right. I just. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't like that. [SPEAKER_D]: So what's possible is he was a werewolf and he saw a seer and now he's saying the reverse. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, I just don't trust like a villager to do not. No one could back. [SPEAKER_D]: Did anyone switch his. Whoever was the. Actually both of you answer. You're both claiming turtle maker. Did either of you switch? [SPEAKER_A]: I did not know Mike. I swapped you two. I swapped you two. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, right. [SPEAKER_A]: Piece of shit. I hate that you're lying to my face and everybody else. I hate it. I just think you're coming a bit. No. I'm so mad right now. Oh, God. Don't. Just don't. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, so there's a Tanner on the board, and we must not vote for him. Now the real question is he is a seer or a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: You're trying to make me think you're. No, you. I'm a troll maker. Mike's you. I'm a troll. I agree. Mike's a werewolf. You're making sure. [SPEAKER_C]: So then stop the timer. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, I don't know who I'm voting for. [SPEAKER_A]: Were you the tanner to start? So Justin's the tanner and Mike is the werewolf. I think Mike's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: One minute remaining. [SPEAKER_A]: Are you both werewolves? No, I'm a troll maker. You guarantee me you saw two werewolves. There's no possibility these two could be werewolves? [SPEAKER_C]: No, I'm guaranteeing I saw two werewolves. [SPEAKER_D]: Mike's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: I just don't like. Because then he can see two werewolves. [SPEAKER_D]: Or he's a seer and we should not be voting for him, you know. [SPEAKER_A]: But I will gladly fall on that blade. [SPEAKER_D]: I would err on the side of him being a werewolf because Justin's losing. [SPEAKER_C]: Either way because it's a tenor, so he doesn't care. [SPEAKER_A]: Both werewolves. [SPEAKER_B]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_A]: No, it doesn't add up. It doesn't add up. Wait, there's two werewolves and one. Hey, why don't we all just vote for either? [SPEAKER_C]: I'm either I'm the only werewolf, or I'm the seer. I would. I've given my robber. [SPEAKER_A]: Who did you steal from? [SPEAKER_D]: I stole from Justin. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, and you switch us too. Yeah, so that means I'm the Tanner. No, time is up. [SPEAKER_D]: No time is up.

[SPEAKER_D]: I did switch James with somebody, but I would like to know what. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, that was the one that Mitchell. [SPEAKER_B]: As a single werewolf. He also looked at the insomniac, and that's why he claimed it. [SPEAKER_E]: He's the original Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: No. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you switch it with me? [SPEAKER_D]: Yes, I did. [SPEAKER_C]: Us too. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: And James. [SPEAKER_B]: So you want to die? [SPEAKER_C]: I don't want to die. [SPEAKER_B]: I know, but you don't know. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm playing as the seer. [SPEAKER_B]: You don't know that. You want to die then if we've been troublemade. Mitch is a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: I started as a Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: No, Mitch, you're the werewolf. Mitch is the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Are you sure you didn't start off as the werewolf? [SPEAKER_B]: I am 9,000% sure. [SPEAKER_D]: You start off with the tanner? [SPEAKER_B]: Yes. [SPEAKER_D]: Why did you reveal yourself as a Tanner, though? [SPEAKER_B]: Why don't I reveal myself as the Tanner? Because if you trouble made us. And well, I know I was a Tanner, so I know Mitch wasn't the fucking Tanner. If you troll made me and Justin, we would I try to kill myself? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: I would lose for the villagers. I'd be a seer right now. [SPEAKER_C]: I think that sounds legit. [SPEAKER_B]: Mitch is a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: I started as a Tanner and the exact same justification that he threw out there is exactly what I went through. [SPEAKER_B]: Good argument. [SPEAKER_D]: I was argument or else they were both werewolves and they just somehow got in this argument. I think the safe bet is. [SPEAKER_C]: What happened. [SPEAKER_D]: I don't know, but I'm good. [SPEAKER_E]: This fucker stole my entire Tanner story and he's fucking kicking himself over it. He loves it. He fucking loves it. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm good to vote. [SPEAKER_B]: I fucking. We had a story. It was good. And you guys started talking. Mitchell's like, no, but I was a Stanner and that's exactly what just happened to me. So even if. Are you good? [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, we switched us too yesterday. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I was a Tanner and I'm not happy about it because I didn't get switched. So I'm. I woke up as the Tanner and this sucks. And I'm lost this game. [SPEAKER_C]: But you're gonna win if you're the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: Yep. Mister's a werewolf. Let's vote. [SPEAKER_E]: You pushed the wrong button."}

[SPEAKER_D]: So far, everything could be adding up. [SPEAKER_C]: So you switched us to. [SPEAKER_D]: I should have. I should have asked him. Fuck. Instead of just saying I should have asked him and I could have confirmed it. I should ask him who he switched because I know I wasn't switched as an insomniac. Now what's possible is he was a werewolf, he saw a troublemaker. Now he's just calling it. [SPEAKER_E]: Can I be legit with you guys? I didn't switch anybody. I took the opportunity to not switch. So we knew there was a troublemaker. So we'd get information like this and find out. People would just give out information easier. [SPEAKER_C]: I vote for myself.

[SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: If I find out one of you guys is lying to me, can we. [SPEAKER_D]: Abstain from voting for the sake of. [SPEAKER_B]: Can we vote center? [SPEAKER_D]: Because if we always vote to the left, and let's say there's a tanner there and he. They want to just. Just to. Oh, no. So that wouldn't do anything.

[SPEAKER_F]: No, that's Justin. No, the first time was me. [SPEAKER_B]: You're touching me right now. Yeah, I figured. [SPEAKER_E]: I was like, how is this possibly you? [SPEAKER_F]: Because I've got my feet all the way over there. [SPEAKER_E]: I know. [SPEAKER_C]: I was like, God damn it, Justin. Seer, please. [SPEAKER_B]: You're the seer. [SPEAKER_C]: I was the seer. [SPEAKER_B]: What did you see? [SPEAKER_C]: I looked at two at the center. [SPEAKER_B]: Nice. [SPEAKER_F]: What'd you see? [SPEAKER_E]: Strong play. [SPEAKER_C]: Strong play. [SPEAKER_E]: Why wouldn't you volunteer that right away? [SPEAKER_D]: It's pretty soon into it. [SPEAKER_C]: It is still pretty soon. [SPEAKER_B]: They were only a minute in. [SPEAKER_D]: Really, there's not that much more information. There's still three unknown people. [SPEAKER_E]: Did you wake up as a seer. [SPEAKER_F]: Certain I can't win at this point? [SPEAKER_E]: Correct. [SPEAKER_F]: With no werewolves, or am I misunderstanding? [SPEAKER_D]: I know a minion can win as long as a villager dies. In this case. If this is true. [SPEAKER_E]: So did you switch with Mitch? [SPEAKER_D]: I hate to say it. So if I was to say this, you guys don't believe me. If I. Well, you would. It would be crazy. And if I said this, you don't believe me. So I'm. Obviously the answer is this. I'm almost like. Like, not it's this one here. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, so what if we kill the minion Werewolves. If there's werewolves, which there's not there. But does that do anything to the werewolves as the minion is killed by themselves? [SPEAKER_B]: If the minions killed by himself and there's no werewolves, the villagers win. [SPEAKER_D]: If. Sorry, say that again. [SPEAKER_B]: If the minion is killed and there are no werewolves, the villagers win. [SPEAKER_D]: If I. I started as a drunk. If I picked up one of those two and we kill the minion, I would win. If I picked up this one, we kill the minion, then we all win. So the question is, I think Mitch is a werewolf. Which one did I pick up? [SPEAKER_C]: Which one did you pick up? [SPEAKER_E]: Let's go, Mitch. Let's do it. Come on. [SPEAKER_D]: I already said which one I picked up. [SPEAKER_B]: You said pick up this one. [SPEAKER_D]: That's the one I said. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, but isn't it a safer bet I said town. Isn't it a safer bet to kill Mitchell over Caitlyn? [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, kill Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: But doesn't Minion win if a villager gets killed? [SPEAKER_B]: Mm, no. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yes, yes. [SPEAKER_E]: Who cares? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. So if I picked that one and you kill me, she wins. [SPEAKER_B]: But if Mitch is a werewolf. Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: And you kill her, I win. [SPEAKER_C]: That's a hard choice, Mitch. [SPEAKER_E]: Let's just kill. [SPEAKER_D]: The only way we can all win is if I picked this one and we kill her. [SPEAKER_C]: The only way. [SPEAKER_D]: That's the only way we can. Most of us can grab. [SPEAKER_E]: Let's go, Mitch. If you saw two werewolves, odds are he grabbed one. [SPEAKER_C]: If you. I mean. Yes. [SPEAKER_E]: There you go. Yes. Kill Mitch. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, that's the minion. Adds a weird aspect because it wouldn't matter if we killed off Mitch if he was just the robber after he switched them. The whole group loses if you kill off a villager. No. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, the minion wins. [SPEAKER_C]: There was no minion. [SPEAKER_D]: Sorry. [SPEAKER_F]: And we group loses if you kill off a villager. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, yeah, that's right. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_F]: Okay, so really, the only added aspect is I win and you guys lose. [SPEAKER_B]: We have 38 seconds. [SPEAKER_D]: I picked up this card and if we kill her, we all win. [SPEAKER_A]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_B]: Oops. [SPEAKER_E]: Sounds like a win, Rachel. So he's trying to push us a win. I don't like it. [SPEAKER_B]: So these two are both pointing to Mitchell. Who are you feeling? You want to point to Mitchell? [SPEAKER_C]: Well, it's a safer bet, right? I don't. [SPEAKER_D]: It's a loss. It's a loss. [SPEAKER_E]: Mitch, look me in the eyes and honestly tell me he's shit. He's a werewolf. He's a werewolf.

[SPEAKER_D]: But if I was a drunk, I got a werewolf. Then I switched it for a middle one for another werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: So which one do you want to say? [SPEAKER_D]: Ah, fuck. How do I. Well, my answer is drunk. [SPEAKER_A]: How's it going, Spot Monk? [SPEAKER_D]: How do I make you guys believe me? [SPEAKER_A]: So you switch with me. [SPEAKER_B]: I didn't switch. [SPEAKER_A]: Exactly. Because you're the drunk. Drunks can't switch with people. Yeah, foolproof. All right, which one did you switch with? [SPEAKER_D]: I don't remember. To be honest, I do remember. [SPEAKER_C]: What did you look at? [SPEAKER_A]: So then we're leaving her as a werewolf? [SPEAKER_C]: No, no, I switched. [SPEAKER_D]: I put the werewolf back in the middle. [SPEAKER_A]: That's right. [SPEAKER_C]: You put the world back in the middle. Who did you. What did you look at? [SPEAKER_A]: Oh, Mitch. [SPEAKER_D]: I know it's not looking good. [SPEAKER_A]: What's it, Justin? I can confirm. I'm still the insomniac. Beautiful. [SPEAKER_C]: And you, you saw Insomniac? [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. Okay, and he said that like. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, I just didn't hear it there. [SPEAKER_D]: No one saw any of the middle cards? [SPEAKER_C]: No one saw any of the middle cards. Sorry. [SPEAKER_D]: 60% chance that I'm a bad dude. [SPEAKER_A]: Vote for me. [SPEAKER_D]: I mean, I had no way out of it. [SPEAKER_A]: Well, yeah. No, it's not. It's a 66. But there's three out of the four cards in front of you are bad. [SPEAKER_D]: No, but I had a bad one, and I switched it for one of the middle ones, so it's 60% chance. [SPEAKER_A]: I know, I know. Your math is 100% right, but I'm just saying. But if everyone."}

[SPEAKER_A]: I looked at him, which means Caitlyn. Did anybody look at the center? What'd you steal? [SPEAKER_D]: I stole from you. [SPEAKER_A]: Can you confirm? Yeah. So there were no werewolves. So were Caitlyn, and I was the minion. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, shit. [SPEAKER_A]: So there is a 66% chance that it's me. [SPEAKER_C]: Why is there 60? [SPEAKER_A]: Because two werewolves are in the center. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, she switched out. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Man, that drunk just keeps making it like a gamble at the end here. [SPEAKER_A]: Whether the stupid drunk. Whatever, let's gank her.

[SPEAKER_F]: I switched with this one. Did you look at that one? [SPEAKER_D]: I did look at that one. [SPEAKER_F]: What did you see? [SPEAKER_D]: I'm not gonna say. Okay, well, because two people are claiming drunk right now. [SPEAKER_E]: How was it waking up? How was it waking up? Was it eh or. Oh, it was what? [SPEAKER_D]: There was a bit more hair everywhere. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't know. I don't know. What do you. You guys give some info? [SPEAKER_G]: I said I was the drunk. [SPEAKER_E]: So these guys are both claiming drunk. [SPEAKER_F]: I switched at the middle. [SPEAKER_E]: Do I have to claim something? You guys will just like James for it. [SPEAKER_D]: And James isn't getting all, what if I just. I don't believe him. [SPEAKER_F]: Well, the drunk holds no weight. My fate is really in if the seer saw anything. Because I really don't know what I am. I just know that I was the drunk. Like I really risked nothing by volunteering that information saying, hey, I switched with this. [SPEAKER_D]: It's true. [SPEAKER_G]: But I. If he said that, I would not claim to be the drone. [SPEAKER_D]: Which one did you switch? [SPEAKER_E]: Here's the thing though. [SPEAKER_G]: I switched with the center. [SPEAKER_D]: You still. You switched with the center. So both of you claim that you switched with the center. [SPEAKER_F]: That's bullshit. You're just copying my story like Mitch. [SPEAKER_D]: But here's the craziest thing. [SPEAKER_E]: Here's the craziest thing. We got a little bit more afoot because I stole from Mike and I did not see a seer. [SPEAKER_D]: That's bullshit because I was the seer. [SPEAKER_A]: Wow. [SPEAKER_D]: So you did not see. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay, I had a really dramatic free night. I went to sleep as an insomniac. [SPEAKER_F]: You went to sleep as an insomniac. That's a lie. [SPEAKER_A]: And I didn't fall as. And then I was just awake as an insomniac, so. Fuck. [SPEAKER_F]: So who was the seer? [SPEAKER_D]: I was the seer. [SPEAKER_A]: And who's the drunk? [SPEAKER_F]: I was the Mike. If you were the seer, what was the center card? [SPEAKER_D]: If you looked at it, it was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, shit. [SPEAKER_D]: So both of you. [SPEAKER_A]: So now which one was the drunk? [SPEAKER_D]: Who's now the werewolf? [SPEAKER_E]: Which one did you switch center? [SPEAKER_D]: I think one of them's the minion. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, that's true. [SPEAKER_D]: One of them's a werewolf. One of them's the minion. [SPEAKER_F]: But Mike wasn't a seer. According to you. Are you not backing him up? [SPEAKER_E]: I'm backing him up. I. I was just. [SPEAKER_F]: That sounds like horse. [SPEAKER_D]: What is that for? [SPEAKER_E]: Just to stir the pot. [SPEAKER_F]: I don't like that. [SPEAKER_D]: I think. I think this is what's happening, right? [SPEAKER_E]: What do you think, Mitchell? [SPEAKER_A]: I can't piece it together yet. [SPEAKER_D]: I. I think. I think we're outnumbered. [SPEAKER_F]: I disagree. [SPEAKER_E]: I just don't see how three people could fuck up that much as werewolves. [SPEAKER_D]: I don't think it's. [SPEAKER_E]: I don't think they would both complain like declared drunk if they were both. If we were all on the same team. [SPEAKER_F]: No. I'm starting to question Mike is this. [SPEAKER_D]: Year I am this year I am not lying. [SPEAKER_F]: I don't know. I don't know. I don't know about this. I don't know about this. Oh, I'm backing you up now thing. [SPEAKER_D]: I don't know about that either. I'm not involved in that. [SPEAKER_G]: I. [SPEAKER_F]: If I had to place a hunch just because I can't confirm my own story. I think this year's in the middle. Not the middle middle. The middle three. But I was a drunk and I switched with the middle. [SPEAKER_E]: What if I. Okay, what if I said I was just doing that shit with Mike because, like Mitchell, I stole from James? [SPEAKER_D]: I know. [SPEAKER_E]: And I can confirm that he was not the drunk. [SPEAKER_A]: So why would you say. [SPEAKER_F]: Why are you changing your story three fucking times? Would be my question. [SPEAKER_D]: If he got the werewolf, you were the werewolf then. And she. [SPEAKER_A]: If you were the werewolf, he now has it. Do you want to admit to having the werewolf? [SPEAKER_F]: No, I wasn't the fucking werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: I believe you. [SPEAKER_E]: I. [SPEAKER_G]: If he was the drunk. I looked at my card and looked at it really wrong. [SPEAKER_E]: James was not the drunk. [SPEAKER_A]: Who do you believe, Mike? Or who do you think is a werewolf? 40 seconds left. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, there was only one werewolf because I did see a werewolf and a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_F]: You saw a troublemaker right there? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_F]: Okay. Mike's not the fucking seer. I was the werewolf. I saw the fucking werewolf right there. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay? That's dope. [SPEAKER_F]: Justin is a fucking werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Did you actually. [SPEAKER_E]: I actually stole from you. [SPEAKER_D]: Justin's a werewolf and she's the drunk? [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Which one do you switch with? The mid center one. So she's troublemaker because I switched them because you both were claiming the center. [SPEAKER_A]: Wow. [SPEAKER_F]: Gank Justin.

[SPEAKER_F]: And that would back this up? [SPEAKER_D]: Sorry, just simply. I don't care what your roles are. Who can back up who? Just point at who. You can back her up. [SPEAKER_E]: I can confirm I am now the robber. [SPEAKER_C]: So you can back me up. [SPEAKER_B]: You go back and you can back. [SPEAKER_C]: I didn't look at the card. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh yeah. That's how you fucked it up. Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: This is a possibility. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, cuz they're only yeah, and then. [SPEAKER_D]: She saw the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_E]: No, because she'd have to be the troublemaker for me to. [SPEAKER_B]: For us. [SPEAKER_E]: For me to. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, because you were the insignia. You were the seer at the start. Right. [SPEAKER_D]: Sorry, what? [SPEAKER_C]: Because she was the seer at the start. He was the seer at the start. She switched them, then I. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, it makes sense. [SPEAKER_D]: Sorry, who's backing up stories? [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, so he was the seer. [SPEAKER_D]: We can back that up. [SPEAKER_E]: No, because. [SPEAKER_C]: Because I never looked at my card. [SPEAKER_D]: That you never looked. [SPEAKER_B]: Should be the seer. He fucked up by not looking at his card when he robbed it. That is the seer, though. [SPEAKER_D]: He robbed that card and didn't look at it. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, that classic fuck up. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, I mean, he should still be able to look at it, cuz he. [SPEAKER_C]: No, no. Well, I shouldn't be able to. [SPEAKER_B]: So can. [SPEAKER_D]: Can we confirm for a fact that he's a seer? Well, I'm still not seeing why this isn't a possibility. [SPEAKER_C]: Because Mike was. [SPEAKER_B]: Because James was the insomnia. [SPEAKER_E]: This story to even work out. [SPEAKER_F]: This couldn't happen. [SPEAKER_E]: For me to wake up the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: That story has to. [SPEAKER_F]: I have to be the troublemaker. Yeah, so that's not possible. [SPEAKER_D]: That makes sense. Yeah, you're right. James. [SPEAKER_F]: The only person up in the air. [SPEAKER_E]: Sorry. [SPEAKER_D]: Yep. [SPEAKER_F]: Mitchell, you're something. And Mike could. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, I could just be saying she's the troublemaker. She did reveal it first. And I never had a chance to reveal anything. Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: What if we just all vote left? [SPEAKER_B]: No, but Mitch, if. If our story checks out. He is. [SPEAKER_C]: But if you. [SPEAKER_D]: If you all vote left. [SPEAKER_A]: At least 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_E]: I like our odds. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, vote me. Yeah, that's neurons. I'm fucked. [SPEAKER_A]: Time is up. [SPEAKER_B]: Everyone happens a lot.

I like it, Mitch. You convinced me. Solid story. [SPEAKER_C]: Thank you. [SPEAKER_B]: Solid story. [SPEAKER_C]: I had it figured out. [SPEAKER_F]: It was pretty, pretty good. [SPEAKER_C]: Does anyone not want to go to a vote? [SPEAKER_D]: Who? No one. Mike. Mike interacted with no one as a seer. No one interacted with Mike. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: So whatever Mike says could be bullshit. Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: I say we vote. Mike. [SPEAKER_C]: What? [SPEAKER_E]: I don't know. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, you. [SPEAKER_C]: Minion. [SPEAKER_E]: He could be a werewolf. He could have been that drunk. [SPEAKER_D]: So you were a minion. [SPEAKER_C]: I was a minion. I woke up. [SPEAKER_D]: Were you a werewolf? Justin, be honest. [SPEAKER_B]: I mean, he's still. I don't know if he's gonna say that. If you were a robber, who did you rob from? [SPEAKER_F]: So what would you find more believable? If I said. If I said Mitchell or if I. [SPEAKER_B]: Said Caitlyn that you robbed from. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I was an insomniac. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: And I woke up as a minion. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah. So then in that case, the answer would be Mitchell. I was just testing the waters to see what answers you Guys find most believable. [SPEAKER_B]: Mikey, you could have robbed one of us too. [SPEAKER_F]: I don't. I don't. No. [SPEAKER_D]: I don't trust Mike as well as Justin. I agree. Justin's a smart choice, but I don't trust Mike because he just interacted with no one and no one interrupted with him. His story could be fine, but it's. There's no way to corroborate. [SPEAKER_C]: I was minion. So I did get to see who all the werewolves are. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: And I just saw one werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Just saw one werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: And I was so ready to back him up. And then you switched my card. And I was like, I'll throw him under the bus. [SPEAKER_F]: You know that's life, right? One second. You have a minion. [SPEAKER_B]: Wasn't that way. Thank you. [SPEAKER_D]: So, wait, sorry, who. Who are we missing here? [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, there's a robber here, which I'm guessing Justin woke up as a werewolf and he saw the robber. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah, it's pretty solid. Unless, you know Mike is also lying. Right, but what if he was the. [SPEAKER_D]: Robber and he robbed a werewolf? [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, he robbed me and now I'm the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: I mean, that's a possibility. [SPEAKER_B]: That is a possibility. But I wasn't. I'm just the seer. Because how would I know there was no seer available. True. [SPEAKER_D]: And the. [SPEAKER_C]: But I. That's a good one, Justin. That's a good one. [SPEAKER_D]: But I think the odds are voting for Justin's the only smart choice. I'm with Mitchell, but you could be playing a fantastic fucking mint. [SPEAKER_B]: Mitch could be lying. [SPEAKER_C]: That could be. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah. Mish. [SPEAKER_A]: One minute. [SPEAKER_C]: There's a lot I could probably be doing. [SPEAKER_D]: Look me in the eyes and tell me truthfully. [SPEAKER_C]: I was a minion and I saw him as a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: You saw him for what he really was. [SPEAKER_E]: Yes. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. He looked me in the eye. [SPEAKER_C]: You switched our cards. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I was an insomniac. [SPEAKER_D]: I just don't know you well enough to say look me in the eyes. So, yeah, I'm. My vote's locked in because she could. [SPEAKER_B]: Have been a werewolf too. But then I don't know why he'd be pushing. [SPEAKER_A]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_E]: Why would I admit to being a minion if I didn't know that I was a minion and not a good enough liar to get out of it. [SPEAKER_B]: Because I don't know. [SPEAKER_D]: I really. [SPEAKER_B]: You're saying you're a minion and you're actually a werewolf because you don't want the vote. [SPEAKER_D]: But I felt really strongly for Mitchell's case, and I don't like when you guys sway me away from dumbbell to fl. [SPEAKER_F]: No, man. [SPEAKER_D]: No, man. [SPEAKER_B]: You can build a four. [SPEAKER_F]: Voting for me is the most logical one. I just don't want to get if Mike was the robber. No, vote for me was great, but three."}

[SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, I can confirm that 100%. [SPEAKER_C]: He's not the werewolf because I wasn't the werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: All right, so then I trust him because he doesn't want us to vote for Paul.

If this was this. If these were both werewolves and we were all for sure not werewolves. And nobody switched these. How do we win? [SPEAKER_B]: We all vote to the left. Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Right. [SPEAKER_C]: So there's no majority. No one dies. And us three villagers live happily. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't trust you for some weird reason, though. I just don't. Yeah, you're. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm making myself so untrustable. [SPEAKER_B]: But yeah, like, I don't know. But you would. [SPEAKER_C]: Happily ever after. [SPEAKER_B]: You would vote for, like. Yeah, I feel like, why would you be going along with this if, you know, I switched them? Because he would lose. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. If I was a werewolf and you told me we switch him, I would. [SPEAKER_B]: You guys are both werewolves, right? [SPEAKER_C]: What if you're a werewolf? [SPEAKER_B]: Well, then I lose no matter what. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. If we were both werewolves, we would. If we were both werewolves and we knew we would just vote you out. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. That would be kind of game breaking at that point. Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: It's so easy. [SPEAKER_B]: So I say we go to a. [SPEAKER_C]: Vote and I'll vote to the left. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm with you on that. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm gonna vote to the left. If I. [SPEAKER_B]: If you guys kill me, I understand. Like, if it's because you're like, yeah, you're both werewolves."}

[SPEAKER_A]: I was a villager from the beginning. The fuck is he doing? [SPEAKER_C]: What were you? How do you know? [SPEAKER_D]: But you and I were werewolves together. [SPEAKER_B]: What are you doing? [SPEAKER_A]: We're not werewolves together. He was a werewolf, and now he's saying I'm a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm not a werewolf. I was just joking around, bro. [SPEAKER_C]: Bro. [SPEAKER_A]: All right. I was a villager, though. I really was. You guys villagers. Villagers all around. We have three villagers. [SPEAKER_D]: Three villagers. Go with that elbow to the left. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. I was a troublemaker, so we know what happened. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, geez. [SPEAKER_A]: Is troublemaker optional? [SPEAKER_D]: Yes, it's a me. [SPEAKER_C]: It's a me. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Didn't know that. So y'all were switched. [SPEAKER_A]: Were you a werewolf and now I'm a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I was a robber. And I can confirm that you were. [SPEAKER_A]: A villager, so that both werewolves are in the middle again. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: Or he was a werewolf and. [SPEAKER_C]: Hey, no, not this, but this. And then this. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, basically. [SPEAKER_A]: So either we're all villagers again, or he was a werewolf and he saw a troublemaker and he's taking advantage of it. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm not. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, you are. [SPEAKER_C]: No, no, I'm the troublemaker. I think that's what the three player is going to always come down to, though. [SPEAKER_A]: Unless there's two werewolves, there's not enough stories to. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. To check. [SPEAKER_A]: Check. [SPEAKER_D]: Especially when someone says they're a villager. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Which you are. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: I saw your card. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: You should take the villager out and throw another character. [SPEAKER_D]: I agree with that. I agree with that. [SPEAKER_C]: Because then we know somebody wasn't just like, oh, I didn't do anything. [SPEAKER_D]: So you're 100% legit. He's a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. All right. [SPEAKER_D]: I was a werewolf. So we should kill Mitchell. Yeah, I was. [SPEAKER_A]: No, you weren't. No, because I was the werewolf. No, you weren't. Yeah, I was. I was a werewolf at the beginning. And now he's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: What? [SPEAKER_C]: You can't just both fucking do that. [SPEAKER_A]: I was a werewolf. And now he's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: He is defending because he wants to win as the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: So you weren't ever the robber? [SPEAKER_D]: No, I was the werewolf from the beginning. [SPEAKER_A]: You fucking were. [SPEAKER_D]: And I looked in and he knew. [SPEAKER_A]: I was a werewolf because he took it from me. He was the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_A]: And he took it from me, and he was trying to hide it. And then we realized. You're a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: Here's. Here's the thing that you can prove that I was a werewolf because. Because Mitch actually declared himself as a villager before I declared myself as anybody. So I feel like as a werewolf, which I was, I didn't want to make any declarations of what I was. [SPEAKER_A]: Because you called me out as a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: I did as a joke. [SPEAKER_A]: And I jokingly said, I'm a villager because I saw villager. It was this one when I was a little. You didn't. Yeah, it was. [SPEAKER_C]: I believe, Justin. No offense. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, I'm with you. [SPEAKER_A]: This is the second time I want the record to go down. Second time telling the truth, and it's not going through. [SPEAKER_B]: Time is up.

[SPEAKER_D]: No, he's lying. I don't understand why you're lying. Yeah, no, I want to know what. [SPEAKER_C]: You're lying. [SPEAKER_D]: What could you possibly be? I want to know what you. [SPEAKER_C]: I was a seer and I saw two werewolves right here. [SPEAKER_A]: No. [SPEAKER_D]: No, you fucking didn't. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I fucking did. [SPEAKER_D]: This is so much better now that there's no villager. I love this. K. I don't know what's going on. What K. What did you do? You switched. [SPEAKER_A]: I'm the troublemaker. I want to hear what you are before I reveal what I did. [SPEAKER_D]: But you would have. The troublemaker has to switch to other. [SPEAKER_A]: It's a may. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, but. Okay, but if you take an action, that's the only action you can take, right? [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. Oh, Mitch is the insomniac. He knows he's the werewolf now. [SPEAKER_C]: No, I'm the seer, and I saw two werewolves here. [SPEAKER_D]: I was a werewolf. You switched us. Mitch is the insomniac. He knows he's a werewolf. That's what's up? Yeah, that's what's up. [SPEAKER_C]: That is not what's up. [SPEAKER_A]: So you were the insomniac. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I was a werewolf. 100%. This is a werewolf card. This is a werewolf card. [SPEAKER_C]: I was starting as a werewolf in the beginning. I saw two werewolves right here. [SPEAKER_D]: No, this one is. I don't know why you guys would listen. This is. This is how you know Mitch's story cannot. There's no way Mitch's story checks out. I started as a werewolf. If I started as a villager or something else, I would not be lying about that. There would be no reason to be lying about that. This is the card I looked at. It was a werewolf, and I was like, fuck. That gives me no information. Great. Thank you. Except Mitch is giving bullshit about where the werewolf cards are. I know. [SPEAKER_C]: I came out right out of the gates, and I was like, boom, I'm a seer. I got loads of info. These are werewolves. Nailed it. You got it. [SPEAKER_D]: You switched them. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't know what he's doing. [SPEAKER_D]: So now he's the werewolf. He started with the insomniac. He knows he's now a werewolf because he got to see it right at the end. So that's why he's giving this BS to. [SPEAKER_C]: I started with the scener, and I saw one werewolf and another werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Were you the robber? [SPEAKER_C]: I was not the robber. [SPEAKER_A]: Were you the robber? Did you steal a werewolf from Paul or. [SPEAKER_C]: If I did, if I did that, I would be kind of confident that maybe you switch us back, and I would say something, and I. I did not do that. I was not the robber. [SPEAKER_A]: I just don't get why you guys are both saying that he's this. No, but I don't understand what's happening, other than the fact that maybe you guys are both werewolves again. [SPEAKER_D]: No, we're not. I'm the only werewolf. Or I was the only one. [SPEAKER_C]: There are two werewolves in the middle. [SPEAKER_A]: This is so fucked. [SPEAKER_C]: This is so fucked. I feel like we threw an extra werewolf card. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, no, that's what this is giving me, too, because I'm like, what? Because I was the only one. Did you switch us? No, I was the only werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: I didn't. [SPEAKER_C]: You didn't. [SPEAKER_A]: I didn't. [SPEAKER_D]: If you didn't switch us, then I'm a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Then he's still a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: But then how did you see two werewolves? [SPEAKER_C]: I didn't. I saw one werewolf. I was a seer and I looked at his, and it was a werewolf. Oh, and then you were. As soon as you pulled the troublemaker card, I got scared and I said, there are two in the middle. So we kill Paul. It's Paul. If you did not switch. [SPEAKER_A]: I didn't switch. Yeah.

[SPEAKER_B]: Hold on, let's stop. [SPEAKER_D]: So I'm just saying he's either troublemaker, insomniac, or werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: What were you when you woke up? [SPEAKER_B]: You know, I know what you are, and you know what I was. Because, you know, I knew what you are. You do? [SPEAKER_C]: Yep. [SPEAKER_B]: Yes. [SPEAKER_C]: Yep. [SPEAKER_D]: So we got a robber and insomniac over here. [SPEAKER_B]: We have a possible werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: What were you, Justin? [SPEAKER_D]: I was a troublemaker and I switched you guys. I'll give that up freely because I believe you guys telling your each. I believe this story that you guys are making here. Like, not making up, like the story that is going on here. [SPEAKER_C]: So two possibilities. He was a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: For real? Yeah, I'm a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: For real. Or he was a werewolf. He saw a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: That is not correct. [SPEAKER_C]: If he was a troublemaker for real, I probably would have noticed. [SPEAKER_B]: He would have, but I didn't. [SPEAKER_D]: Did you wake up as an insomniac? [SPEAKER_C]: Woke up as an insomniac. [SPEAKER_D]: Did you steal from him? [SPEAKER_C]: He was not the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: He was the seer. [SPEAKER_B]: Hold on. Whoa. I gotta. I gotta do this in my head. Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: He got milk during his night face. [SPEAKER_B]: You woke up as the insomniac? [SPEAKER_C]: Yes. You were the robber. This whole time I thought you were the seer. Because I woke up with the insomniac. [SPEAKER_B]: No, it was the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: Did you switch deal from him? Yeah, and I switched from you and I switched you guys back. That all checks out. [SPEAKER_B]: You had no information that. [SPEAKER_C]: No, because I knew it was one of these two. But since I woke up with the same person, I was like, must be Cyr. Because if it was Robert, we would have switched. That was my logic. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Which is wrong. Okay, So I thought you were a seer and you saw me. [SPEAKER_B]: No. My whole point was that you should have woken up seeing a robber. Card known why I knew what you were, because I had it. [SPEAKER_C]: I woke up with insomnia. [SPEAKER_D]: So this all checks out. I mean, like, there's no way that. Is it possible? [SPEAKER_B]: He's lying. [SPEAKER_C]: You were an actor. [SPEAKER_B]: Literally? [SPEAKER_D]: I don't think so. [SPEAKER_B]: Really? Say that. That's literally the only possible level. [SPEAKER_D]: All right. [SPEAKER_C]: To the left.

[SPEAKER_D]: This doesn't look good for me. [SPEAKER_A]: The question is, which one of these two is I? Well, I'm on the good team, so I'll tell the truth. I was insomniac and I woke up as myself.

[SPEAKER_A]: No. First round. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, first game. You're telling the truth. [SPEAKER_A]: I killed him. [SPEAKER_D]: So you're not a robber or a troublemaker? [SPEAKER_A]: Nah. He was the seer, right? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. I was the seer. [SPEAKER_A]: You're the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: If you had to kill one of us, who would you kill? [SPEAKER_A]: You. [SPEAKER_D]: Why? [SPEAKER_A]: Because he's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: What if I'm the seer? [SPEAKER_C]: You're not. You would have fucking said something by now. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm the seer now. I'm trying to gauge if he. [SPEAKER_C]: The only way you're the seer is if he's actually the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I'm trying to gauge out if he was the robber and he stole from me. No, I'm trying to gauge that out for me. [SPEAKER_A]: Could be. Keep it in mind. Wait, which. [SPEAKER_C]: I went first. Right. Cyr? Yeah. Robert's been near the end right before. Insomniac, I think. [SPEAKER_A]: Mm. [SPEAKER_D]: It's a seer, robber, troublemaker, insomniac. Because the insomniac is a safe bet. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I feel. I feel like that's kind of bullshit. [SPEAKER_A]: Justin's werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: So what happens if we both vote for Mitchell again? [SPEAKER_A]: Then I die. Yeah. And werewolf wins. The original werewolf wins. So either go off what you see or what the guy that you saw as a werewolf is telling you. Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Right. Are you admitting you started as a werewolf? [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. You have to admit that if you want. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm admitting that I started. I'm admitting that I started as a. [SPEAKER_A]: Werewolf, and I was insomniac, and I saw myself as the insomniac, so I know you weren't a troublemaker. That's why I was able to guess that you were a seer. Because I knew you weren't a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: Knew you weren't a robber. Yeah, that makes sense. I guess. It's me. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh. Cause you knew I didn't switch with you. You there? [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Should we call a vote? I'm fucked. I am. Like, this is bulletproof. [SPEAKER_A]: Are you ready to vote? I'd be ready to vote. [SPEAKER_D]: It all checks out. I can't. I. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: So Justin is still. [SPEAKER_D]: Werewolf war. [SPEAKER_C]: It's. You're the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I. I think he. I mean, yeah, he want me dead. It's. But it's up to you which one you trust. [SPEAKER_A]: But do you trust the guy who, you know started as a werewolf? Or she trust the person you don't know anything about? By default, I should be trusted with 13. [SPEAKER_C]: You're so shady about it. [SPEAKER_A]: I know. I'm so shady about everything when I play this game. I mean, I totally could be another werewolf, even. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, I think Justin's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Look, two out of three chances. [SPEAKER_C]: I know Justin's still the werewolf."}

You're no. That would give you info. What do you mean? You have no. If he has no info, he's this. And he woke up as the insomniac. Or is the troublemaker. And he didn't do anything. I don't buy it. I don't buy it either. I'm thinking the next game, we should bring in the Tanner. Yeah, I feel like that'll add a nice bit of chaos to this game. The Vigilance. Yotta. Okay, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hey, Wayne is gonna win. How's it going, Troublemaker? If you switch, you have to do with two players. You're right. You can't do it with yourself. Robber also has to switch with a player. Yes. Is robber a must or a may? May. Everything is a may. Everything's a may. But if it. But if it does, it's not coming out of the center. Correct. That's all junk that does that. These are both werewolves. These are both werewolves? Yeah. You're the insomniac. I'm the insomniac. What are you. Did you switch? Why? Well, did you switch us? Why? I was an insomniac. I woke up as the insomniac, and these were. You're saying these are werewolves? Yeah. So if you're the troublemaker, then you didn't do anything. Switch. Anyone. I'm good with this, then. Okay, so to the left. Both werewolves. Aren't you? That's so weird. They're both werewolves. I'm calling it right now."}

Okay, we did our stories. Now Paul, vote them out. [SPEAKER_D]: Which side of the story were you on? Left or right? [SPEAKER_A]: God dammit. Oh, so I said I was the seer. Mitch said he's the robber.

[SPEAKER_D]: Huh. Well, I was a robber. [SPEAKER_A]: And you stole from Paul. [SPEAKER_D]: And I stole from Paul. [SPEAKER_A]: Paul, what did you wake up as? [SPEAKER_C]: This one's hard. [SPEAKER_D]: This one's a goddamn chest puzzle. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't even know what the fuck my strategy is right now. [SPEAKER_A]: Well, did you wake up as a robber? [SPEAKER_C]: I'm so confused. [SPEAKER_D]: Me too. [SPEAKER_A]: What did you see when you looked at this card? [SPEAKER_D]: I didn't look at it after I picked it up. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't believe that for a second. [SPEAKER_D]: I saw an insomniac. [SPEAKER_C]: I think Mitch started with the tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: I saw an insomniac When I. I had robber and I switched it for insomniac. And so you woke up as the robber. Unless he's doing some sort of weird switch. There is no troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh yeah. I took out. [SPEAKER_A]: I'm scared. [SPEAKER_C]: This is. This is fucked. [SPEAKER_A]: So you stole from Paul and what did you see? [SPEAKER_D]: I saw an insomniac. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay? [SPEAKER_D]: He's telling the truth. [SPEAKER_C]: Alright? [SPEAKER_A]: I think Mitch is the tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: You saw the tanner? [SPEAKER_A]: No, I never looked in the center. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, you did. You saw the tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: No, I didn't. [SPEAKER_D]: Which one did you. Who'd you look at? You looked at him. [SPEAKER_A]: No, I just know you're lying. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't think he is. I think that he robbed me. [SPEAKER_A]: But he's saying you're the insomniac. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: One minute remaining. [SPEAKER_C]: This is weird because it's like we know we're good, but you saw this stuff.

[SPEAKER_A]: But you saw his card. [SPEAKER_D]: No, he's. He's insomnia. I don't know. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm rubbing my. Are you okay with voting left here? [SPEAKER_A]: No one gets killed. I think there's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: You're the one I don't trust. [SPEAKER_D]: I think there might be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Wait, are you okay with voting left? [SPEAKER_D]: I think it might be Paul. [SPEAKER_A]: So should we vote right then? [SPEAKER_D]: I don't know, man. [SPEAKER_A]: We have nine seconds.

Trouble. Even before he says I'm gonna corroborate his story. Diagonal. Wow. That's. I'm a little. Okay, so you are claiming. No. I don't know. I'm corroborating his story because I was the robber and I traded with Hawk. Uh huh. Okay. Both werewolves. I. I was the seer and I saw something. A troublemaker and a werewolf. You saw what? I believe you saw what? You waited until I said troublemaker before you saw troublemaker. Noticeably suspicious though. I think she's the Tanner. Yeah, I agree with Hawk. Classic. We're on. Definitely noticeable. Don't play this game drunk. I agree with hot. She's probably the Tanner. I agree with. No, she's down for the Tanner. She saw a troublemaker in the middle. Really? I. Or she's a werewolf. I was this year. I saw the Tanner and the werewolf and I. Yeah, troublemaker werewolf for sure. That's all I got. Correct. I was the troublemaker. So you are lying. You guys are corroborating each other's stories immediately. He was the troublemaker. Why does he have the robber token on his card? Because you're a liar. That's why. I was the Robber. All right, who is the drunk? All of us. It's in the middle. Correct. Everybody in this game is also the drunk. But also I'm weirded on by how strongly you believe me. Next question. Next question. Because he's a liar. I was in the garden. I was the robber. I was the robber. I think. I think you were the robber and you took a werewolf. I know that you were the hunter. I literally can't be the tanner unless someone switches. Were you the hunter? I was. That's what it's werewolf team. Am I right? Werewolf team right here corroborating each other. I told you I was the werewolf. With the waiting until the very end when there's a few unclaimed roles and then claiming she's one of the unclaimed roles. Not the end. Werewolf. Three minutes left. Mr. Werewolf, you are the tenant. Wait, what? Mr. Werewolf, you're the hunter? Yes. Wait, who did I say I troubled me? You said these two. It was these two. You are lying. I don't hear the werewolf. You may find. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just look at the footage and you'll clearly see that I made them do the diagonal disco together. Did you? Yeah, but Meryl saw the troublemaker in the middle. But you're a fucking liar. No, listen to me. Anyone who is a villager right now, I appeal to you. There are no villagers. There's no villagers. Okay? No. If you're like villager team. Okay, stop interrupting me on the villager team. You should not vote for me. I am not the Tanner come from. Okay, I'm trying put the drunk and I switched with one of these cards. I switched with this one. It's probably werewolf. Sorry, Robin. So you're the troublemaker. No, I'm not. Because that wasn't the troublemakers. He was the troublemaker and he was the robber that stole the car. No, you can't look. You're not supposed to look at the defense of the driver. She's extrapolating. I'm extrapolating from I disbelief. Meryl. Okay, I'm gonna reveal a new information. I was still the robber. I looked at her. She was this year. She's telling the truth. Don't werewolf.

I don't buy him as the seer. What were you? I was the troublemaker. You were the troublemaker, are you? Who did you make trouble? I'm not telling yet because there's a lot of lack of clarity here. But I don't believe that the seer would only look at one card and it would be the villager. What? Looking away, that sounds like a werewolf. Were the robber too. Who? I was the robber one. No, bullshit. You are a werewolf. I was the robber and I stole the seer. No. You're corroborating his story. Yeah. Why are there two werewolves out? Because there are two werewolves. I would have been telling the truth because they both. At least two people are lying here. I definitely saw a troublemaker and a werewolf. I'm claiming to be the minion. You're not the troublemaker. You just said you were. Okay, you just said you were the troublemaker and then claimed seer actions, and I was the seer. So that's a lie. Like sketch. Like three people have claimed Seer actions. All three of us claim seer. Yeah, yeah, he's there. Which is. You claimed it originally and you said you looked at one card and it was a villager, which sounds like a troublemaker. No, no, you just said you just put the troublemaker in the middle. Literally. I'll tell you if you let me talk. I have been this year, like, three times. One of them, we didn't actually play, I think, but anyways, I've seen the things in the middle of a lot of times. One time, I saw a troublemaker and a werewolf. This time, I just saw the troublemaker and. Or I just was the troublemaker. And then this. Those are very close words. You just swap some of the consonants and you get it, so I understand the confusion. No, I'm listening to Merrill now. You just said you were the seer. Like, 10 seconds ago, you just said she was the seer. What? You're confusing. You're confusing. I don't think you were the seer. I will say, Meryl, that you are successfully making trouble. What did you see? Robin, you're the teen. Oh, my God. You're a werewolf. Hawk, are you the drunk? You're a minion? I don't know. I said. I said it 20 times. Now I know everything. I don't buy either of you my favorite. That's fine. I'm not available for purchase. Daryl. No, no, no. Wait. Is that. We're supposed to come in on Harmony on that one. Do it again. Do it again. No. Okay, we're almost at 20. Wait. Hawk has the Hawking. Hawk has the Hawking spin. I am the punter now. Vote for Hog. Vote for Hog. He's the hunter. Vote for Hog. He'll make the truth. All right.

[SPEAKER_B]: Also, one thing. Chat. I saw. Everyone, don't wake up, you cheaters. It actually falls on you guys. Please don't put spoilers in chat because we just can't avoid chat for five minutes. Just so everybody knows we still want to respond to you and answer you guys and stuff. So. Yeah. What did you see? What? Whoa. Mitch is a werewolf. I'm just kidding. He's just joking. I'm ultimately useless. I was a drunk. I switched with someone in the center. Let's not put political commentary out here. So I hope that someone looked in the center because I would love to know what I've become. So do I have a seer that maybe looked in the center? I was. The seer's a dirty fucking liar. [SPEAKER_A]: Fuck off. [SPEAKER_B]: No, actually, I am lying. James, did you look in the center? I did. And here's the fucked up thing. So Mike's a dirty fucking liar too, so that's awfully suspicious. So, yeah, he's probably a werewolf. He saw a revealer in the center. He's a drunk. That makes sense. No, I'm the drunk. No, he's the drunk. That's. What did you become? So he was a werewolf that saw that I swapped with this one. Okay, so I am now a revealer. Unless James is lying. He would not lie about that. That's a bold lie. Yours is the easy lie. Alright, you three. Cause Mike's a werewolf. Well, I got insomniac again. So did you wake up as the insomniac? Mm. I was the robbers. That would mean he has to be a Tanner. I was insomniac, so I don't know Were you. At what point did you wake up James? We just have to kill Mike. Okay? Unless Mitch stole from Mike. No, I did not steal from Mike. Who did you steal from? I stole from you. Can you confirm that story? I can confirm that story. I don't believe you did you have to kill Mitchell. Wait, wait, wait. Suddenly I want to kill all three. Not me. I'm good. What do you. Why can. Because he. Robert goes before. He would have saw. I would have saw drunk. I saw drunk. It's true. But he got drunk. He confirmed he was one of those things where instead of saying I switched with you, Justin, I had to ask him. And that made me immediately lose all trust in him as a person. I'm still saying I'm the reveal though. You're not the revealer. So we do have two conflicting stories. You are either the Tanner or the revealer. I think he wants us to kill. The reason why I think he is the werewolf is because he gets a look in the middle and see the revealer. Yes. Wait, who do you switch with again? I switched with this one in the center and that was the revealer. Yeah. See, that's why I think James is telling the truth. Because he put two things down. That's true, right? Yeah. Just be going for a very bold. I'd have to agree. I think that's werewolf. You probably saw review. I mean, it makes sense. It checks out a little bit. So. A little bit, huh? Let's just kill Mike. I'm on board Scott's Julie Quandries. Yeah, we can kill Mike. Okay, that's two for Mike. Alvin, Mike Train. Chugga chugga choo choo. Leaving the station. Do you want us or do you want us to kill you? Wait, but decided. Who's saying that? I think someone just. No, Mitch put it. I put it there. Just process of elimination was the last good thing there, so. And he hasn't really denied it. I need. I need one more vote of Mike Transkill. Okay. I say Mike. I say Mike. That. That confuses me. Why? I don't like when people team up. Well, I just feel like if Elvin was the Tanner, he would try to do something that would switch it up a little bit. I don't think Alvin's clever. It could be that too. I think he's just like, ooh, I've been made. That's too bad. That's why I'm asking what he was. And if someone put this down. Shit. You woke up as the insomniac for sure. I don't know that that happened to you twice. It did. What are the chances I didn't see her twice? Good point. Good point. What are the chances of me being the Tanner twice? Yeah. Sorry, Mike, though. But I was so Julie's story probably checks out, so. And Mitch, you stole from me. I did. All right. Who would you kill here? It would have to be Mike so far. Okay, that's four on board. The microphone. What is not aligned. I would not be ready to go to vote right now, but if I had to, it would be Mike. [SPEAKER_A]: One minute. [SPEAKER_B]: Rem trying to like, punch another hole in the story here. You can't because I. Something feels fishy to me. These. I honest. Fuck. I'm not sure I believe Justin. These are the roles I'm sure are up in the air, but I'm so confident in my. Why don't you believe me? I asked you what I asked you. I know, but the drunk's just too easy. The drunk is one of the hardest and scariest roles to play. What if he's tanware because you. [SPEAKER_A]: But only 30 seconds left after. [SPEAKER_B]: But I don't know. Yeah. The reason why I think. I feel like. I think Mike's Tanner. The reason why I don't know if he's the Tanner is because he. He went with the Revealer for the sole purpose of getting someone else to be the target. Because he could say, I saw a werewolf here at the table. Because notice how nothing was revealed. If that's the case, then he looked at Albans and saw the Tanner. If he was the Revealer, he would have flipped over one of these cards. He has an 80% chance that that's the. The case. [SPEAKER_A]: Time is up, everyone. Three, two."}

[SPEAKER_E]: I put the robber here because I. [SPEAKER_C]: Know you robbed at 6. [SPEAKER_E]: You would have seen me as the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: I saw you as the robber. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, okay.

Everyone, wake up. [SPEAKER_A]: I turn that off. [SPEAKER_C]: That's good. There has been a Snapchat competition going on. Yeah. I swear to God, if one of you guys, when you woke up at night, took a snap on me, that would have been so. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, shit. [SPEAKER_A]: I couldn't. [SPEAKER_C]: All right. Why are you hiding your role, werewolf? I might as well just hold on to that. All right, so does anyone have useful information about what they did at nighttime that could potentially help the villager team? Here are the villager roles that people are gonna declare. Here's the tanner that Mitch will probably declare. And here's the werewolf that Mike is. [SPEAKER_A]: Checks out. [SPEAKER_C]: Checks out. [SPEAKER_A]: Although I want to know what you guys were. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm just listening. Or, hey, I'm just gonna wait a little bit. [SPEAKER_B]: I think I'm waiting slightly longer than him. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. So no one's gonna talk. So none of the villagers want to actually help the villagers win. [SPEAKER_B]: That's cool. [SPEAKER_A]: I'm a villager that doesn't have a. [SPEAKER_C]: Lot of information, so that means you were the drunk, so possible. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm also not that helpful. [SPEAKER_B]: Dang. [SPEAKER_C]: So this is not the case. Just so everybody knows, because there's only one bad role for the villagers that's not helpful to them. [SPEAKER_E]: What is it? [SPEAKER_C]: The drunk. [SPEAKER_E]: Why are any. Wait. [SPEAKER_B]: How's it going, Invisible Simmer. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, the drunk knows he's a drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: And moves things around. [SPEAKER_C]: No. The drone just exchanges a card with them in the center and doesn't get a look at it. [SPEAKER_A]: So unknown what they are at the end. [SPEAKER_C]: So we made it. We wasted 90 seconds. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, I know. [SPEAKER_C]: What? [SPEAKER_E]: I went to bed. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you do something at night? [SPEAKER_E]: Nothing. Nothing at night. [SPEAKER_C]: So that means that you were a Tanner. Yeah. Okay, well, that's easy. [SPEAKER_E]: If you want to say that, that's what I was. [SPEAKER_C]: Mitch, what are you. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't know. I'll narrow it down to two of them. [SPEAKER_A]: How about that? [SPEAKER_C]: Sure. Go for it. I was one of these two sick. I can confirm that someone at the table is lying because someone claimed a role that I went to bed as. [SPEAKER_A]: Nice. [SPEAKER_E]: Who is it that's lying? [SPEAKER_C]: Mike. I was the drunk. [SPEAKER_B]: Were you? [SPEAKER_C]: I was. [SPEAKER_E]: Can you confirm, Mike? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: I can't confirm. [SPEAKER_C]: Hmm. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, so you robbed from him? I was. [SPEAKER_A]: And I took the drunk card. I was seeing if he would. [SPEAKER_B]: You were testing him? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: But then he called you out right away. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. Yeah, which is good. It's what I wanted. [SPEAKER_C]: No, that's a weird thing to do. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't know. [SPEAKER_C]: Especially because right now I am literally assuming I'm a villager. But I could likely be a werewolf. Yeah, I could be anything at this point. So that's why I need other people to start talking. Otherwise, I'm gonna assume I'm the werewolf and I'm just gonna kill somebody. Okay, so kill me. [SPEAKER_B]: What in the heck is Mike doing here? Do we believe Mike? [SPEAKER_C]: I don't believe anybody. Except for maybe Julie, because I feel like she doesn't know what the Tanner does. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I do, and I'm. Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: You're okay with living? Yeah, I'm fine. Okay, but you do. You're not okay with living, then? No. She's playing a fucking werewolf. She's so good at lying. [SPEAKER_B]: She's fucking with us. [SPEAKER_C]: She's like, oh, this is my first time playing. What's the Tanner Do? [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, my God. [SPEAKER_C]: So, Mitch, what were you. [SPEAKER_B]: Actually, I was the troublemaker. I mixed two people up. He was one of them. So now I'm trying to figure out what the heck he was. [SPEAKER_A]: So did you just switch as a bag? [SPEAKER_B]: I don't want. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't. I don't know. I. [SPEAKER_B]: Pause. [SPEAKER_C]: We have 90 seconds. [SPEAKER_A]: I was 100%. Robert. [SPEAKER_E]: I. [SPEAKER_A]: 100%. I stole from Justin. I saw the drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: What are you saying? [SPEAKER_E]: Nothing. I was just saying no one's gonna. [SPEAKER_A]: Make him say that he was the drunk because I didn't think he was gonna say it. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm gonna kill somebody. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay. Do we believe she's a Tanner? No. Okay, I swapped these two. [SPEAKER_E]: But you didn't. [SPEAKER_C]: Ooh. [SPEAKER_B]: Which is really, like, fucking with me. [SPEAKER_A]: So I think we killed Justin. [SPEAKER_B]: I kind of think that she was the Tanner and that he was the Were. [SPEAKER_C]: Kill her? [SPEAKER_B]: Like, I think she's now our best bet. [SPEAKER_A]: No, I think. I think it's Justin. [SPEAKER_C]: I mean, it could be. I have a 33% chance, assuming that there's only one werewolf in there. Yeah, I have a 66% chance of being good. So, Julie, were you actually the Tanner? Because Mitch said he switched you and Mike. [SPEAKER_E]: You switched me and Mike? [SPEAKER_A]: Yes. [SPEAKER_E]: Are you lying? [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_E]: If you switched me and Mike. [SPEAKER_B]: Probably. [SPEAKER_E]: Want to kill me now if he was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: But, no, I was the robber. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, I'm killing somebody. Just. [SPEAKER_A]: So wait, I think we kill. I was the robber. If you were the Tanner, then I'm now the Tanner. It's either her or I think it's Justin. [SPEAKER_B]: No, no, because I actually think you were the Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, fine. You just want me to fess up. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: That's all you. Okay, I. When I was awake, I saw the Tanner card. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, we have to vote, everybody. I'm killing Julie. [SPEAKER_E]: You're killing me now."}

[SPEAKER_C]: So I actually don't know this. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, so, Mitch, where did you start it? Oh, you said you started one of those. So. [SPEAKER_C]: So one of you guys are lying, not me. [SPEAKER_D]: Wait, why did you just switch that? [SPEAKER_E]: Because I robbed him. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, so you were the robber, robbed. [SPEAKER_E]: Him, then that's what you and I saw. The troublemaker. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, I can confirm I did switch some people. [SPEAKER_C]: Can you tell us one of the people you switched? Because I. I think the person who's taken my role a. Wasn't you. It's one of these two. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, I know which one. [SPEAKER_C]: And then I think they. They are a werewolf, because I can't think of another reason unless they're. They're tannering right now. [SPEAKER_D]: You switched me with somebody. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, well, so do you still want to say that you're the seer? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. Okay, I started with that, and I looked at a card. [SPEAKER_B]: What card did I look at? [SPEAKER_D]: Yours. [SPEAKER_B]: What did you see? [SPEAKER_D]: Troublemaker. Cool. So who did you switch me with then? Or do you switch from a middle? No, you wouldn't. [SPEAKER_B]: No, I had to switch two people. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, two people. I didn't know what this was for. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, so then Mike's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I'm not. I'm not the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Because you robbed Justin and got. And saw that you got Troublemaker. [SPEAKER_B]: I did switch Mike and Julie. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, so now he. [SPEAKER_E]: So this happened. Okay, yeah, that would happen after I robbed. So were you still this year when. [SPEAKER_D]: What? [SPEAKER_B]: Well, you. [SPEAKER_E]: You still saying that you were the Seer since you're not it anymore. [SPEAKER_D]: I mean, I. I guess now I'm the troublemaker. If they were switched. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, but your original role. [SPEAKER_D]: My original. Yeah, I'm still saying yeah. Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Holy. [SPEAKER_B]: So what were you, Mitch? [SPEAKER_C]: I was the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_B]: That's. That's a lie. [SPEAKER_D]: Wait, how. [SPEAKER_E]: That is the lie. [SPEAKER_C]: Wait, wait, wait, wait. Why is Mike start out us? [SPEAKER_E]: No, no. [SPEAKER_B]: Or the Tanner? [SPEAKER_C]: Wouldn't Mike claim to be. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, shit. [SPEAKER_C]: The robber. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: That's what it was. You know. [SPEAKER_E]: No. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't know what to do because I think Mitch might be the Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: I think he might be the Tanner too. [SPEAKER_C]: Is it just me or your palm sway my knees? [SPEAKER_D]: We're. The question is why? So you both are confidently declaring your titles like. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, perfectly fine. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, so that. Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: Cuz I was the troublemaker and I switched some people around. Yeah. I was wrong. [SPEAKER_E]: And he said that we switched, so. And you still said you were the seer. So I still believe you were the seer. [SPEAKER_B]: Would you guys be upset if I told you Julie was not actually one of the people I switched? [SPEAKER_C]: Why would you do that? [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, a little bit. [SPEAKER_B]: But it was you and Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, okay. He's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: So you were the Tanner? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: So I'm the sear. [SPEAKER_B]: I didn't switch anybody. [SPEAKER_D]: You didn't switch anybody? [SPEAKER_B]: No. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, it turns out I'm the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: All right. [SPEAKER_C]: Actually, I was wrong. I really wasn't. [SPEAKER_B]: I really was. I'm okay to vote left. Really? [SPEAKER_E]: He's gonna it up. [SPEAKER_D]: You're gonna kill me now? [SPEAKER_B]: But if he doesn't die, he still loses. [SPEAKER_C]: If I'm not gonna. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, wait, so you're saying you were the robber and didn't switch? [SPEAKER_B]: No, I was the troublemaker. I didn't switch anybody. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, and you were the robber? [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. I robbed from him. I confirmed he's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: If he's the Tanner. If he's. [SPEAKER_E]: I think he's the Tanner. He has to be the. [SPEAKER_D]: But if we kill him, he also. [SPEAKER_B]: Could have been the drunk. And he's just playing one of those things. That also could be the case. [SPEAKER_E]: This is what's in the center right now. I mean, this. If he was the drunk, that's what's in the center. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, I think we just. I think we just don't kill Mitchell. And if he's the werewolf, that's that. We're not killing anyone. Now we still vote to the left. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: What? Oh, I see. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, I'll vote to the left. Mitch will fuck it up. [SPEAKER_B]: But if he's a Tanner. I don't think he will.

What a weird recommendation. [SPEAKER_B]: I've never thought. My body is untouched. It's like a canvas for God. [SPEAKER_C]: So untouched. [SPEAKER_B]: Remember you guys since Draconis invasion. Yk Sino, it's great to have you back. Let's talk about this, though, because we have four minutes. [SPEAKER_C]: You were the drunk, weren't you? [SPEAKER_B]: No, I was the werewolf in the Tanner, as what says on my card. This is what my card says at one point. [SPEAKER_E]: You were drunk, though, weren't you? [SPEAKER_B]: No, I know I don't drink. Like I said, canvas of God. [SPEAKER_D]: Taking serious. [SPEAKER_E]: Believe it or not. Believe it or not. [SPEAKER_B]: I know. [SPEAKER_E]: I was crazy, I was crying, but I was legitimately the seer this time. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, if you were the seer, when. [SPEAKER_E]: I looked, he was the drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: Interesting. Mike, what were you? [SPEAKER_D]: I was one of these two. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, so if you're not playing in the dark anymore, then you. [SPEAKER_C]: I was also one of these two, so whichever one you choose, choose fucking wisely. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. I better not lie, right? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: So when one is the drunk, they have to switch with the middle, right? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Yes. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, so I mean randomly, and they don't get a look, so they don't know who they are. Are you okay with. [SPEAKER_B]: That's what you were. I am one of these three things. Yes. [SPEAKER_C]: These horrible, horrible things. [SPEAKER_B]: All right, you guys can't judge me for my addiction. Alcohol. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay? So if someone Was a troublemaker. Then did any switching happening happen? Can anyone confirm that? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, I can confirm that switching happened. [SPEAKER_E]: What was switched? [SPEAKER_B]: Well, if you guys all believe I'm. [SPEAKER_C]: The odd man out, what was the order of it? [SPEAKER_B]: It goes robber. [SPEAKER_C]: So I robbed and then you. [SPEAKER_D]: So you looked at drunk before and then you robbed and then I troublemaked. [SPEAKER_E]: Yep. [SPEAKER_D]: And then he drunks. [SPEAKER_E]: And then he drunked finally with something in here. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: So whatever he has, he has because he was last. [SPEAKER_B]: I was. Obviously from the beginning. [SPEAKER_E]: Why would you want to. [SPEAKER_D]: I, I, I trouble make Justin and Julie. [SPEAKER_E]: You what? Sorry? Oh, you troublemaked. [SPEAKER_D]: I troublemaked us. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh. But perhaps I could be the drunk. No, no, no. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, yeah. But he still does the switching after he's last. Right? [SPEAKER_B]: So I was never the drunk. [SPEAKER_E]: What? [SPEAKER_B]: I don't drink. [SPEAKER_E]: Justin, he's the tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: He's totally tannering right now. [SPEAKER_E]: He's the tanner now. But I swear to God, I saw drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, did you? [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, sorry. [SPEAKER_E]: At the beginning. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. I can confirm her story, by the way. Totally. [SPEAKER_B]: How do you trust them? [SPEAKER_C]: Because I was a robbery. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, actually. Well, I trust at least would then. [SPEAKER_E]: Be this now, wouldn't you say? [SPEAKER_D]: Yes, because he didn't try to. When I chose the right one, he didn't try to fake me out on the wrong. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, so you saw a drunk. Well, I think that we just vote Justin. Justin. [SPEAKER_D]: Because this is what's in the center. If he was the drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: So we got a 66% chance of winning. [SPEAKER_E]: Why are you not claiming that you're the drunk, though? [SPEAKER_B]: Well, because I was the drunk and there's nothing I can do. I literally die to odds. Or I win to odds. [SPEAKER_C]: He's got a funny position. If he was a. [SPEAKER_E]: That's hard. [SPEAKER_B]: The thing is, one of you guys could easily be lying. None of you are like. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I'm just. [SPEAKER_B]: Mike's story. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, Mike's story is unchecked. [SPEAKER_D]: Although I think my story is checked because when I, when I had the two, I chose the troublemaker. And it was, I mean, it was a 50. 50 shot, technically. [SPEAKER_C]: I mean. Yes, yes. [SPEAKER_D]: If I was lying. [SPEAKER_C]: That's something. [SPEAKER_D]: That's something. [SPEAKER_C]: You didn't wait for me to do it or anything? [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_C]: Who did you trouble make? [SPEAKER_D]: It was these two. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, so now. [SPEAKER_C]: So really she's the risky one, isn't she? [SPEAKER_B]: No, no, no, no. I still do the drunk action. [SPEAKER_D]: She does. She does drunk action last. [SPEAKER_C]: I mean, I think just. I think this game comes down to. [SPEAKER_B]: Luck and I think we just vote. [SPEAKER_C]: Justin and it's 66% chance we win. But I don't know, what if. [SPEAKER_E]: Just saying what if they're two werewolves, that means that we're just completely. [SPEAKER_B]: I mean, I feel like it's more likely these two are werewolves because they're confirm each other's stories. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, that's also true. [SPEAKER_E]: I mean, unless my seer was switched to someone else, I would be. If I was a werewolf, I would be completely oblivious to it. [SPEAKER_B]: We have six, five seconds to vote. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm voting Justin. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: Rest in peace, guys. [SPEAKER_E]: I don't. I want everyone. Because he's the."}

[SPEAKER_D]: Justin's actually employing that strategy right now as one of the two werewolves blaming. [SPEAKER_C]: Other people as the werewolves. [SPEAKER_E]: So we have no revealer. [SPEAKER_D]: So we're 40 seconds in OR. [SPEAKER_E]: I saw something bad. Just kidding. I'm not the revealer. I wish. I got pun rules. [SPEAKER_D]: Who is the revealer? [SPEAKER_E]: Is there a revealer? [SPEAKER_D]: No, I guess. Hey, that's another way of starting the game. [SPEAKER_E]: We never do that. [SPEAKER_D]: We ask people to tell us what they are, but now we can. [SPEAKER_E]: What are you? [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, I don't want to say. [SPEAKER_C]: You think he's the werewolf? [SPEAKER_D]: I'm the insomniac. [SPEAKER_B]: Ooh. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you wake up as what you were. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm gonna hold off on that info for you. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't think you did. [SPEAKER_B]: Do we have anything that switches things out? We have a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, yeah. Trouble. Okay, so I could have been. Without saying insomniac. I'm gonna say that I am the rest of these ones. [SPEAKER_D]: All of them. [SPEAKER_C]: I can guarantee you I'm one of. [SPEAKER_E]: The ones that just existed. These two. [SPEAKER_B]: But you could be one of the werewolves. [SPEAKER_E]: Yes, but I can be both of them. [SPEAKER_B]: Definitely not that werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: And not the Tanner either. No, just Tanner straight out. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, no. Did I take the Tanner out? [SPEAKER_C]: Just. [SPEAKER_E]: Let's keep it a mystery. I don't throw this one back in. All right, what about the other side of the table? Because I've actually put some rules down. In front of my card to show that I'm. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, sure. Right. [SPEAKER_E]: There we go. [SPEAKER_D]: Pass them around. Caitlin's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: I am the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, so we. I. I'm very sure we have a werewolf here. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, yeah, I think we definitely have two. [SPEAKER_C]: I think we. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, I think Caitlyn's a werewolf because she's held off so long on. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, she's repping one of those two. [SPEAKER_D]: That's a dangerous. [SPEAKER_E]: That's a dangerous game for everyone in the table. [SPEAKER_D]: So do we have no good people? Cause, I mean, I'm. I'm good. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, what did you see? [SPEAKER_D]: What do you mean, what did I see? [SPEAKER_C]: Are you still the insomnia neck? [SPEAKER_D]: If you guys reveal that one of you are a troublemaker, that would explain something. It would explain something. You guys haven't given me anything to work with here yet. [SPEAKER_E]: God damn it. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't think he woke up as. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, well, then who's the troublemaker? That's the only way I can switch. Then you must be the troublemaker. If you're not the troublemaker, he's the troublemaker. I don't think he's the troublemaker. Nah, she's not the troublemaker. Maybe I'm the troublemaker. I'm the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, see? Okay, Who'd you switch? [SPEAKER_D]: I switched. Nobody. So now you know. I woke up as an insomniac. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, well, Spama Knight has officially lost it. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm gonna go. [SPEAKER_D]: I know Spamik has gone crazy. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm go out on a leg, and I'm gonna say that I was a werewolf when we started. [SPEAKER_C]: That's a good leg. I like that leg. [SPEAKER_D]: You're okay. [SPEAKER_C]: I like that leg. [SPEAKER_E]: Cause I feel like Mitch wants to start seeing some action, and I'll commit to this. Action? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I'll commit to some action. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. I'll confirm that she was not a werewolf with me. So she is a Tanner attempting suicide. [SPEAKER_D]: Do you want to defend yourself against this? Were you perhaps the werewolf? And he's lying. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm gonna plead the fifth. [SPEAKER_D]: Pleading the fifth. What a strategy. That actually is an interesting strategy. [SPEAKER_E]: The fifth is you have the right to an attorney. [SPEAKER_D]: If you cannot afford one, one, we'll be provided for you. So. [SPEAKER_E]: So, Mike, what did you see in the middle? [SPEAKER_C]: I saw a revealer. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, that makes sense, because no one was revealed. [SPEAKER_C]: And there's no drunk, so it doesn't really matter where. [SPEAKER_E]: So then did you wake up with the insomniac? [SPEAKER_D]: Yes. So you're. You're the werewolf. But he might be the Tanner and you need to save us, Ms. Werewolf. I have a feeling she's a werewolf and he's a Tanner. This is my guess. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, he could be a Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: I think he recognized that. There is no troublemaker. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I don't. [SPEAKER_D]: Wait, that's opposite logic I'm using here. I've. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I went out there because I was expecting Mike to be a troublemaker because of the way he was talking. You can kill Caitlyn if you want to lose. That's just the bottom line. She's a tenor. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, she's. I think she might be the tenor too. [SPEAKER_D]: So everything's pointing to Justin. Is it possible he did a good job at being Tanner? [SPEAKER_C]: It's possible. [SPEAKER_D]: Would he do these moves? How? Caitlin, speak up. You have more info than anyone here. [SPEAKER_E]: This is a problem that I took a. This is my. I may. I made a bad decision. [SPEAKER_A]: Time is up, everyone."}

Oh, my God. Werewolves. Wake up and look for other werewolves. I don't like this. You don't like that it's quiet. Yeah, move around. Stop. Is awkward the quiet, isn't it? It's so creepy. Troublemaker, close your eyes. Insomniac. Close your eyes. Wake up. Pocket your card. I'm gonna kill you in your snake. Close your eyes. Revealer, pull into your hand. You may turn any other player's card face up. Turn it back over. Face down, everyone. Revealer. Everyone wake up. Okay, music, but lower. Oh, my God. Yeah, please. So what's everyone thinking? That's a card. I have loads of information. That's sick. All right. Is that load. I was gonna say he's probably the Tanner or he's the insomniac and he didn't wake up as the insomniac or he's the werewolf. A lone werewolf and he looks. Guys. What? Are you guys okay? You just threw every fucking chip on my card. Although there's two left. No, you're definitely not the troublemaker because they have no information. I'll take the troublemaker for now. Oh, intriguing. I'll take a werewolf. I think that's fun and exciting. Sure. I did not have you. Did I open my eyes to early or too late. And I miss you being a werewolf with me. Either you're the Tanner or I'm the Tanner. That's true. We just saw it. I'm not even gonna reveal any information yet. Yeah, where are you, motherfucker? Revol. Reveal. He's one of these. He was the Revealer. Yeah, he's probably the Reveal. He's one of these two. Nice. Revealer has more information. I think he says he has loads, so I'm just playing off. Yeah, that's what I thought when he said loads. I figured he was the Revealer, which means that he saw either a Tanner or a werewolf. So he looked at either me or Caitlyn. Because we are one of the two. Right. Do you want to say if you looked at me or Caitlin? Yes. Alright, which one? As far as I'm going right now. Did you switch? So that means he's the Revealer. Yeah. Yeah. So he's an apprentice. Sierra's out. Yeah. Who did you switch, motherfucker? Did you switch me and Caitlyn? No. Oh, good. I switched you and Mitch. Mitch was a werewolf. I know for a fact that Mike is lying. I know 100% sure that he's lying. So that means. So why are you lying, Mike the Revealer. Mike likes to cause chaos. He could have then been like, he switched me and Caitlin, and we both actually are werewolves. So that means that Mitchell looked at your card and he did not see Revealer. Did not see Revealer. That checks out, because then Revealer would have been face off, and he would have been like, can you imagine going to someone else's house? You just see you inside, just. No. Okay, so then why would Mike lie about being a troublemaker? I think he's just trying to catch someone else in the lie. That makes sense. And there's someone else here lying. Who? I'm gonna hold off for a moment, but I don't understand how anyone else could be lying. Is the troublemaker a may? Yes. Yeah, it is. So he didn't switch. Unless Mitch is lying. That's what he's referring to. Then somebody else. He's the werewolf. All along. He just said Mike is lying. Maybe he's the seer and he saw troublemaker in the center. We need your help. You're the only one. Guys, we're just trying to guess the information. You know, I'm waiting for one of you guys to trip up and then catch you. I think maybe Justin's actually the Tanner. Wouldn't that be a nightmare? I don't know what to do right now. Do we have two werewolves and a tanner? Again, Wouldn't that suck? Is that what's happening, Mitch? Are you running up against two werewolves and a Tanner? Or maybe. Maybe it's you two or the werewolves. I'm really upset right now. No, but Katelyn's a werewolf. I don't know. Fuck me. I don't know. There's too much. What do you mean? I've been burdened with too much information that I'm so scared. Who are you trying to entrap? Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. Who do you not suspect here? I'm bleeding the fifth. I'm bleeding the fifth. I know too much. Or it's that. I know. Or it's that. Oh, I'm definitely the troublemaker. I don't know what to do here. I'm definitely the troublemaker, and I don't think myself. Mike, we just have to vote in unison. It doesn't matter who. It's true. Just tell me who you vote for. Mike, I'm a werewolf. Tell me who to vote for. If you saw me, you saw werewolf, right? You know, you looked at one of these two. You need to tell me. You look at for go. Mike. Mike, you have 25 seconds. You look at one of these two you need to tell me which one you looked at. You tell me a name. And this finger goes to that name. So what's happening right now is Mitchell doesn't trust Mike, and he's trying to see if he can confirm that which one is the other werewolf. Because he thinks Mike might be a werewolf. That's what's probably happening right now. I can promise you I was the only werewolf. I didn't switch anybody. I saw a fucking apprentice seer in the center, and it was a great, happy, magical time. This is chaos. Mike. Tell me a name is up, everyone."}

[SPEAKER_C]: I was the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, He's a Tanner. I was a robber. [SPEAKER_A]: Don't you dare confirm my story. Don't you dare fucking confirm my story. [SPEAKER_D]: I can confirm one of the stories out here. [SPEAKER_A]: This is the Tanner one. Because that's a weird story to confirm. [SPEAKER_D]: The reason why I think he's a. [SPEAKER_C]: Tanner is I'm not confirming because that's not what I claimed. [SPEAKER_D]: Is because he took the token there. He took it with confidence right out of the gate. He took my character with confidence. And that points straight to Tanner, to. [SPEAKER_C]: Me, or immediately conflicting somebody as soon as it was picked. Yeah, Julie, tables le turn. [SPEAKER_D]: You and I know the truth of which one of us was Robert? [SPEAKER_C]: Mm, not as fun. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, I can confirm Justin's story, and I pretty sure he's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: Which one did you pick? Julie? Which one did you pick? [SPEAKER_A]: I mean, we're in hell. Everybody. Just so everyone knows, we could stay with this. [SPEAKER_D]: And then. And then what, guys? [SPEAKER_C]: What? What happens if we stay here? [SPEAKER_A]: No, the crazy thing is this is confirmed. I looked at one of you motherfuckers, and if you notice your cards aren't. [SPEAKER_D]: Up, I can confirm that he isn't Revealer. So he is not lying. So this is telling me. I think you're a Tanner. You're a werewolf. You're a Revealer. I'm a robber. I'm now the revealer. [SPEAKER_C]: Wait a second. [SPEAKER_D]: You're a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Man, do you want to know the craziest thing? I was actually the drunk. We have two liars here, Paul. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I can confirm his story. I can confirm that you were the revenge. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm having major deja vu. [SPEAKER_A]: I was the drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay? [SPEAKER_D]: Except he wasn't. I can confirm his original story and I know you weren't the robber. [SPEAKER_A]: All right, so here's what I'm thinking. Happen. Pull. Unfortunately, Tanner werewolf. That's nothing that's happening right now. And you said you were the robber. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm more inclined to think that she's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: I think she's going hard, though. [SPEAKER_D]: I think. [SPEAKER_A]: I think she started as a Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: Once again, do not vote for me. But I said that last time I was a Tanner. He's lying for sure. 100%. I don't know what's going on over there because I did see a revealer. [SPEAKER_A]: He did not see a reveal. [SPEAKER_D]: 100 saw a revealer. I know you're lying. Okay? [SPEAKER_C]: I'm gonna go on a major fucking limb right now. The other. Oh, shit. Okay, I'm just gonna have to. This is what I think is happening right now. This is what I think this is. You're this. You are this. [SPEAKER_B]: What? [SPEAKER_C]: For sure. And so am I, like the whole time or something. So am I. No, that's what you are now. You were the. [SPEAKER_A]: What was I? [SPEAKER_C]: I believe you were the drunk. If. Okay, okay. I'll full. Full limb. Full impression. [SPEAKER_D]: I don't think she was. [SPEAKER_C]: I was. This is the other werewolf. So if you pick that card, that's what you are. I think Justin revealed you. If you are the Tanner, which I think you are, can we all just vote for Justin? Cuz you're not gonna win. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm not the Tanner. So there's one loophole in your story is I want you to die. [SPEAKER_C]: That's the loophole. [SPEAKER_D]: So we all vote for Paul. Paul, vote for Paul. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't think I can vote for Paul, man. I'm gonna vote for Julie because she claimed my role. That's the bottom line. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm voting for Paul. Mitch, I think that she might be the tanner and I think Paul's a werewolf. I'm voting. [SPEAKER_A]: Then I'm gonna vote for you. Then I'm voting for you. [SPEAKER_C]: Or Julie. Who did you reveal on my birthday? [SPEAKER_D]: I'm voting for Paul. [SPEAKER_A]: I was the drunk. [SPEAKER_D]: So Julie, who you voted for, you vote for. Vote for the werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Paul. [SPEAKER_A]: He said he's your teammate. You should vote for Mitchell or vote for me. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, yeah, I'm gonna if you were the drunk. [SPEAKER_B]: Julie. I voted for Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: You were the. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm voting for Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: Done. [SPEAKER_B]: Vote for me, if you will. [SPEAKER_D]: Cool. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't know who to vote for. Vote for Mitchell. [SPEAKER_D]: Just join the group. [SPEAKER_A]: No. Mitchell's definitely the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: Everyone three."}

[SPEAKER_B]: Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: Megan. [SPEAKER_B]: Lying. Oh, why? Because I'm actually the drunk. I wanted to know who the Seer was. That's why I chose this. So somebody would speak up about it right away. Or else it's in the center. Because I wanted to know what they. If they saw it, too. In the center. Interesting. But I was the drunk. Maybe Megan's the tanner, wants to get picked up, actually. [SPEAKER_C]: Or she was the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: I was the robbery. [SPEAKER_C]: And now you're a werewolf, and I'm a werewolf now. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, this is tannery. [SPEAKER_C]: I believe it. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, that could be tannery. [SPEAKER_C]: And if Paul was the drunk, that means he's one of these things which skews on the side of, uh. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, skews on the side. [SPEAKER_C]: Who did you see? [SPEAKER_B]: I actually did look at Megan. You are what you say you are. [SPEAKER_C]: Yes, I am 100% what I say I am. [SPEAKER_B]: I did look at Megan. [SPEAKER_C]: Was she A werewolf. She was a werewolf. Oh, I like that. I switched you two. [SPEAKER_B]: You said me and Mitch. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_F]: I mean, I didn't actually start as a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: What'd you start as? So you're saying Mike's lying? [SPEAKER_D]: What if Mike started as werewolf? [SPEAKER_E]: What? [SPEAKER_F]: No, I'm not saying Mike's lying. [SPEAKER_B]: How does. [SPEAKER_F]: I'm not saying. [SPEAKER_C]: She's saying Megan's lying. [SPEAKER_F]: What are they. Sorry, what was that? [SPEAKER_C]: So Megan said she robbed from. You and Mike looked at Megan and. [SPEAKER_E]: Said she was a werewolf after the robbery occurred. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, the reveal that goes last. [SPEAKER_F]: Oh, yeah, that didn't happen. [SPEAKER_C]: So what were you. [SPEAKER_F]: I was the seer. [SPEAKER_C]: God damn it, you fucking assholes. [SPEAKER_E]: That's why I was so curious about. [SPEAKER_F]: What was happening with Paul over here. [SPEAKER_C]: All right, so then what did you see? Actually first Paul. Which one did you switch with? [SPEAKER_B]: Why do I have to go first? Does it matter? Do we know what's going on? [SPEAKER_C]: Mitch, here's what you're going to tell me what was in the center without pointing. If you looked at the center, just. Did you look in the center? [SPEAKER_E]: No, I did not look. [SPEAKER_C]: Kenneth Sear doesn't look in the center when there's a drunk in the game. [SPEAKER_D]: I didn't look. Well, I didn't look in the center. [SPEAKER_B]: That's true. She looked at you. [SPEAKER_F]: Okay, so what the is she doing over here? [SPEAKER_D]: I'm a werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: She has to be Tanner, right? [SPEAKER_C]: Was she the Tanner? [SPEAKER_F]: Cuz I. Oh, yeah, you know, she was Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: Robert switches before the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_B]: Yes, I just. I. [SPEAKER_F]: She was just Tanner. And then she's just like playing. Playing with us. [SPEAKER_B]: I mean, I was lying about her, but I wanted to see what she said and she didn't. Justin, you say that you switched. [SPEAKER_D]: Wait, you were lying about me? [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, you're the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: So, Mitch, were you the Tanner when you. When you went to bed? [SPEAKER_E]: No. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you want to die? [SPEAKER_E]: No. [SPEAKER_D]: Did you want to die? [SPEAKER_B]: But I don't think Megan was the rubber from the beginning. I think Justin might be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: With Megan, I am 100% the fucking troublemaker. 100%. I don't even have the will to fight it because this town's getting manipulated. [SPEAKER_D]: I don't even. I don't even know because I didn't start off as the werewolf. So I'm not even sure if there's anybody else. [SPEAKER_B]: I think you didn't start as the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: No, because I swapped. I was the robber. [SPEAKER_B]: She said she was the robber. I don't think she was. I think she was the Tanner. From the beginning. [SPEAKER_C]: And you saw the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: I saw the Tanner. I flipped it back down. [SPEAKER_E]: I think. [SPEAKER_F]: I think you saw the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_F]: You were definitely a robber. [SPEAKER_E]: You were a robber. [SPEAKER_D]: I was a robber. [SPEAKER_F]: Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: Did you actually switch? [SPEAKER_C]: Yes, I switched them. [SPEAKER_F]: Wait, who. [SPEAKER_E]: What? [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, I switched you two. [SPEAKER_E]: What's the. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, I think. I think. I think there's two werewolves in the center. Why don't you trust me? Mike is lying. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, I feel like Mike's lying. [SPEAKER_B]: Mike's lying. [SPEAKER_C]: Why? [SPEAKER_B]: I. Can we just trust me that Mike's lying for sure. [SPEAKER_C]: No, you need to tell me why. [SPEAKER_B]: But why are you trying to be the werewolf? [SPEAKER_E]: I. I'm. I'm into. I. Because I don't. [SPEAKER_F]: Who the do we vote for? [SPEAKER_B]: I think Paul because I'm voting for Megan. I'm voting for Paul because drunk, he is the most likely to become a. I'm. [SPEAKER_F]: I'm into voting for Mike because it's a little fishy here. I don't know. I think Megan's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: He might be the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: Why am I putting stuff on me? I'm not putting stuff on the mic. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm killing Paul. [SPEAKER_B]: Paul. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Cause he's the safe bet. I mean, you were the drunk. [SPEAKER_D]: It's true. [SPEAKER_B]: Let's vote. [SPEAKER_F]: Paul, you have no. That's a bad idea.

[SPEAKER_E]: I will tell you a total honesty about my troublemaking. I switched diagonal. So either switched Mike and Megan or I switched Mitch and Dustin. [SPEAKER_A]: That's interesting. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: Not looking good for you, Meg. [SPEAKER_D]: It's really not. So more than likely. Well, I mean. [SPEAKER_C]: So, Mitch, did you see? What did you see? [SPEAKER_F]: I did see. [SPEAKER_E]: Which one did you look at? [SPEAKER_F]: One werewolf in the center. [SPEAKER_C]: One werewolf in the center. [SPEAKER_A]: I stole from Megan. What's the order there so I can confirm she was the drunk at one point. She might not be now. [SPEAKER_C]: I mean, I want you guys to kill me, so. No, I'm not doing a good job, am I? I don't care. I'm feeling. [SPEAKER_D]: Justin's just playing this game weird. [SPEAKER_C]: I had the soul sucked out of me in the first two hours. [SPEAKER_A]: I would say. I'd say getting rid of the revealer for next round would be good. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, the reveal that nothing was. [SPEAKER_E]: Mitch, you didn't see anything that anyone is claiming to be in the center? [SPEAKER_D]: That and then that. So I'm something still in the middle. [SPEAKER_A]: You're still something from the middle. [SPEAKER_F]: Okay, which one did you take from the middle? Megan. [SPEAKER_A]: But I think I swapped the closest to. But I think Justin. I think Justin was a werewolf. He woke up alone as a werewolf, and now he just doesn't want to talk to anybody. [SPEAKER_C]: I saw a werewolf in the center. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, that's exactly what happened. [SPEAKER_E]: He wouldn't happen. [SPEAKER_F]: I can. I think I can safely say with a lot of info that there was a werewolf here and that is the one she took. For what that's worth. [SPEAKER_A]: There was. [SPEAKER_E]: You saw two. [SPEAKER_A]: You see two in the center or just one. I can't remember. [SPEAKER_C]: You can really throw me a bone and just say you saw two werewolves because I'm the Tanner and this is just my luck. [SPEAKER_A]: No, I think you're the werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: Can anyone corroborate me? I don't can. [SPEAKER_C]: No, no. [SPEAKER_A]: I stole. [SPEAKER_B]: I stole. [SPEAKER_E]: You promised that you're the 10. [SPEAKER_C]: Yes. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't believe him. [SPEAKER_C]: If. [SPEAKER_E]: If you don't believe are the tenor and you're still a Tanner, I will. I will kill you if you're telling me the truth. If you promise you're telling me the truth right now. Like I will vote for you at the end if. If. If. Knowing what I know. I know that you are still. [SPEAKER_A]: So you picked which one in the center? Megan? [SPEAKER_D]: This one. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, so you didn't switch me is what you're saying. [SPEAKER_A]: So this is. I'm confused there. Yeah, yeah, you for sure saw werewolf. So we want. [SPEAKER_F]: Yes, 100%. There was a werewolf here and she's a drunk and she took it. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay, but now. Is there another werewolf on the table? [SPEAKER_E]: I switched you. [SPEAKER_C]: It's just me. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, with. [SPEAKER_C]: So I'M Tanner. Don't kill Mitchell. [SPEAKER_D]: It looks like you have to kill me. Honestly, the way this is playing out. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't think he was the Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: No, he. [SPEAKER_C]: I was a Tanner. He switched me. [SPEAKER_D]: But it doesn't. [SPEAKER_C]: So don't kill Mitchell. [SPEAKER_D]: It doesn't matter unless there's two werewolves. That's the only other thing is if somehow Justin had something that was in the middle. [SPEAKER_E]: Why are you, like, convincing to kill you? [SPEAKER_C]: Because she knows the odds are. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't think so. I think. I think these two were, like, werewolves together or something. I don't. And they're pointing it off. Megan. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I am inclined to believe Mitchell. And if I'm wrong, then good job, Mitchell. [SPEAKER_A]: No, I don't. I don't. I don't trust Justin in this. I thought we had somebody. [SPEAKER_F]: I. I saw werewolf here. [SPEAKER_C]: She said she was just don't kill Mitchell. [SPEAKER_A]: But Mitch's story doesn't. Can't get it. Can't. [SPEAKER_F]: It can't. I will give you that, but I mean, the. Only. For my. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. Now he's a Tanner, so, yeah, I. [SPEAKER_E]: Think we vote for Megan. [SPEAKER_B]: Time is up."}

[SPEAKER_B]: Oh, that's bad news. [SPEAKER_E]: Was it me? [SPEAKER_C]: Yes or no? True or false? [SPEAKER_E]: Yes or no? True or false? No. True. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, now we're. [SPEAKER_B]: So now we're trying to figure out who the werewolves are so we all kind of, like, see what roles we were. [SPEAKER_F]: I will let you know. It was someone bad. [SPEAKER_E]: This is Mitchell. Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_F]: I mean, you're not anymore. [SPEAKER_G]: Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Intriguing. So we have Mike saying he's a revealer, Mitch saying he was the drunk turned robber. Well, Caitlin actually said you were the drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, she called me up. [SPEAKER_B]: Alicia saying she's the troublemaker. Pulsating the seer. And I only have werewolf, werewolf, Minion, Tanner. So things aren't looking too hot for Justin. [SPEAKER_E]: Nope. This is also interesting because I'm gonna tell you right now, I looked at someone's card, and I know who. Minion is. [SPEAKER_B]: Sick. [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, we gotta talk for a few seconds. [SPEAKER_D]: When does the Seer go? [SPEAKER_B]: Seer goes first. After. Like, after the werewolves and the minions. [SPEAKER_D]: So neither Mitchell or I. [SPEAKER_E]: So I know who started as the minion. [SPEAKER_C]: So it's one of those two. [SPEAKER_B]: I was the troublemaker, which is a little bit suspicious. And I switched you two. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh. [SPEAKER_E]: And what's order? [SPEAKER_C]: Do I drunk first? [SPEAKER_B]: No, you drunk after. [SPEAKER_F]: And I reveal very last. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: So you saw a minion? [SPEAKER_E]: No. [SPEAKER_F]: You saw Worf? No, I saw Tanner. Oh, okay. [SPEAKER_B]: No. Well, can you tell us who it is? [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah, it's Mitch Cool. [SPEAKER_C]: I mean, I'm kind of alright with that. [SPEAKER_D]: Checks out. [SPEAKER_B]: He probably drunked himself into it. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: So who did you look at? [SPEAKER_E]: Someone who's lying. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, there's two of us at the table who have the same story. Can you say it's one of us? [SPEAKER_E]: What do you mean they have the same story? [SPEAKER_B]: Cause I'm also saying I'm the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_E]: Ah, it wasn't either of you, actually. [SPEAKER_B]: Spicy. [SPEAKER_C]: Are there any two people that are collaborating each other that are unchecked? [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah, you two. [SPEAKER_D]: I mean. [SPEAKER_F]: I mean, I saw that you were Tanner, so checks out that you were a drunk. Maybe could've just been Tanner from the beginning. [SPEAKER_D]: That's true, but if we were working together, I wouldn't know he was. [SPEAKER_B]: Who did you rob? Yeah, I was robbed. [SPEAKER_D]: I. [SPEAKER_E]: You were the drunk. [SPEAKER_D]: I flipped it over. I saw the drunk. [SPEAKER_B]: I was Robert. Robert. [SPEAKER_A]: Robert. [SPEAKER_C]: Spicy. [SPEAKER_F]: Which one did you switch with? [SPEAKER_B]: I thought you looked at somebody's. [SPEAKER_F]: Did you look at somebody's or was it the center? [SPEAKER_E]: No, I looked at somebody's, but I'm still curious. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm gonna answer that because I don't see why. [SPEAKER_B]: Yep, I agree with that. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, because nobody knows. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, nobody knows. Nobody interacted with the center. [SPEAKER_E]: The werewolves would have found a werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: This is only a single werewolf. Would have found the only werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, if you're a werewolf, you're not a werewolf anymore. Which means you were probably the Tanner to start with. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I'm kidding. I was the Seer. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, who did you look at? We need to know that information. [SPEAKER_E]: I actually did look at two in the center. That's what I was asking. [SPEAKER_B]: All right, which ones do you look at? Was one of them the Tanner? [SPEAKER_D]: Sometimes I think Paul is like really unbelievably suspicious. [SPEAKER_B]: And then I remember I am. [SPEAKER_E]: No, no, no. [SPEAKER_F]: I. [SPEAKER_E]: But I am also suspicious. [SPEAKER_F]: Okay, you said who. Because you said you're the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_G]: I was actually the seer, but I grabbed Troublemaker because he gr. Grabbed it, so I just grabbed one. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, in that case, who did you look at? [SPEAKER_G]: I looked at two in the middle. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh. [SPEAKER_B]: What did you see in the middle? [SPEAKER_G]: I saw Minion and I saw. I can't remember the other one. I'll be honest. I think it was robber. [SPEAKER_E]: Where was the. Where was the Minion? [SPEAKER_G]: Right here. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah, it was. [SPEAKER_E]: Alicia knows that because she's a werewolf and she's the only werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: All right, well, this town has hit a deadlock and we're not gonna win. So I'm going to just sit and. [SPEAKER_E]: Wait to see what happens here. Let me give you some more information. This one is the minion. Alicia and I can both confirm that. [SPEAKER_D]: And these do sound really suspicious. [SPEAKER_E]: And did you actually switch them? I don't know what this one is. [SPEAKER_B]: Who'd you switch? These two. It doesn't matter which. [SPEAKER_E]: Actually, Mitchell, I'm fully. Just Tell you what. [SPEAKER_G]: So you think Mitchell's. [SPEAKER_E]: I'll tell you that this is a good one. If this is one that you switched with, that somebody is claiming, and based on the order. Okay, it's Mike. This is the Revealer. This is the minion. [SPEAKER_F]: Oh, so that information could have been used. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't think Mike, if he was the revealer, he would out someone as the Tanner. Yeah, because then that makes it one less person that could possibly be killed if he's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: I think Mike might be. I don't know. [SPEAKER_A]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_E]: And that's. Yeah, that's also weird, because I don't know how Alicia knew this was meaningless. She literally just guessed. Because it seems to indicate that they're both werewolves. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't have. [SPEAKER_G]: Well, if I know, I think Mitchell might be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm gonna kill Mitchell, because if he's the Tanner, he deserves it. [SPEAKER_E]: No, don't kill Mitchell. [SPEAKER_B]: I have nothing else to vote on. [SPEAKER_E]: Alicia and Mike are definitely both lying. That's all I know. [SPEAKER_C]: Don't vote for me. I'm a werewolf. I want to win. [SPEAKER_A]: Time is up, everyone. [SPEAKER_E]: 3. [SPEAKER_G]: What are we voting? 2."}

We know who's the real trouble out of the three of us. [SPEAKER_A]: Oh. [SPEAKER_D]: I mean, we don't know who. [SPEAKER_B]: So, Alicia, just to make sure that you know what you're claiming, since nothing is turned over, that means that you saw a bad card and turned it back over. [SPEAKER_G]: Yeah. Okay. [SPEAKER_F]: A werewolf or a Tanner. Can you see which one you saw? [SPEAKER_G]: Yeah, I saw a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Spooky, spooky, spooky. [SPEAKER_B]: Was it me or Mike that you revealed? [SPEAKER_D]: Or Mitch or Katelyn? [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, we saw each other. [SPEAKER_D]: That's right. It was Mike. [SPEAKER_C]: It was Mike. And I bet he was a Tanner. Am I right? [SPEAKER_F]: No, she already saw a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: He was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, you know what that mean. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, he's right. [SPEAKER_D]: She did. [SPEAKER_F]: I'm dumb. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I know. Cause, Mike, you're not a troublemaker. What are you doing? [SPEAKER_D]: I'm a good guy. [SPEAKER_C]: What are you doing, Katelyn? All right, Justin, Paul, were you guys good? [SPEAKER_B]: So you. [SPEAKER_A]: You actually. [SPEAKER_F]: I already said someone took a look at me. [SPEAKER_G]: Are you saw werewolf? [SPEAKER_B]: I didn't. [SPEAKER_D]: I didn't go to bed as a werewolf. So I want to know what happened. [SPEAKER_B]: Did you look at two in the center? [SPEAKER_F]: I did look at two in the center. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, the real revealing. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm gonna go it on a limb. I'm young. I'm gonna take a big chance here. I was the drunk sick, and I switched with the center one. [SPEAKER_F]: All right, I did look at that one. You're in the clear, my friend. [SPEAKER_B]: What does that mean? [SPEAKER_F]: You're not bad. [SPEAKER_C]: Which one? [SPEAKER_D]: Which other one did you look at? [SPEAKER_F]: I'm not gonna say which one. I look at. I look at this one, because these two are the closest to me, so I thought less energy to spend. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, and so basically, I'm one of these two. [SPEAKER_F]: Yes. Like, you're one of these two. Or crazy. Let's say the troublemaker, too. [SPEAKER_C]: I did switch, Caitlyn. I switched your card with someone else's. Spooky. [SPEAKER_D]: You said this is good and this is bad. Is that what you're saying? [SPEAKER_F]: No, no, I said that they. Those are the two I looked at. And good news for Paul. He's not a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Who did he is, though? [SPEAKER_F]: He is. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. Cause I was actually the drone. [SPEAKER_G]: You're not telling Greg Switch. [SPEAKER_C]: Not yet. [SPEAKER_B]: Mike's definitely werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Or 10. [SPEAKER_B]: No, he was werewolf. That's what Alicia said. [SPEAKER_G]: Mm. Someone. Did you switch him? Can I ask you that? [SPEAKER_C]: Classic. I'm not gonna say anymore until Caitlin reacts to the fact that I'm telling her I switched her card, even though she's claiming to be troublemaker. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, who'd you switch me with? [SPEAKER_C]: Tell me what you actually were. Give me one piece of info, and I'll help you out. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm not super helpful. I mean, I was a tanner. [SPEAKER_F]: Paul, what would you say if you were the drunk and I saw a drunk in the center? Wouldn't that be crazy? [SPEAKER_B]: That would be. But that's also not true. [SPEAKER_F]: It's not true. It's not illegal either. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, Mike was werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: What do you mean? [SPEAKER_D]: It's not. [SPEAKER_C]: You were a tanner. [SPEAKER_F]: It's not legal. [SPEAKER_D]: I don't. [SPEAKER_F]: We can't have two drunks in the game. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, like, obviously one of us would be lying. Like, I got not lying. [SPEAKER_F]: We're almost telling the truth. [SPEAKER_C]: That's a crazy thing. Okay, so I swapped you two. By the way. Sick. [SPEAKER_F]: High five. [SPEAKER_C]: Shaboom. [SPEAKER_F]: You're a Cyranath, so don't kill Justin. [SPEAKER_E]: Where'd it go? Sorry, man. You're not dying tonight. [SPEAKER_F]: That's okay. [SPEAKER_B]: I appreciate that. We found that out after Justin gave information and helped me. [SPEAKER_D]: So you are actually the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: So here's the thing. [SPEAKER_C]: Even though two people pointed out. Did you look at Katie? [SPEAKER_B]: I stopped by. [SPEAKER_F]: Is she a werewolf? No, Mike. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, she said that. [SPEAKER_F]: Okay, cool. I was a werewolf to start, and I saw a seer right here. That is 100% the drunk. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, 100%. I am the Seer then. Cause I was the drunk. I took that card. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't actually swap you two, by the way. [SPEAKER_G]: This is so funny. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, no, I actually did swap Caitlyn, but it wasn't with Justin. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, sweet. Justin, you'll probably be dying tonight. [SPEAKER_F]: No, I don't think I'm the werewolf anymore. [SPEAKER_E]: Who did you swap me with? [SPEAKER_C]: Let's just. Let's play out what happened with Mike. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm so confused. [SPEAKER_D]: It doesn't matter, because then it would have gone into Center Paul if you were the drunk. [SPEAKER_F]: I don't know what you took. [SPEAKER_C]: I think we gotta vote. [SPEAKER_D]: You were a werewolf, though. [SPEAKER_F]: Nah. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, he was. He was. No, we gotta vote Justin. Why would he do that otherwise? [SPEAKER_D]: If he was a Seer? [SPEAKER_B]: Well, okay, you're not aware, like, I don't know if you help me, but you saw Seer here. [SPEAKER_F]: Yep. [SPEAKER_D]: No, he said, see her here. [SPEAKER_F]: I saw it here. No. [SPEAKER_D]: Changing his fucking mind. [SPEAKER_F]: You think I'm gonna go out on a limb and tell you the whole truth? [SPEAKER_B]: He did, though. He did say it was here, right? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, he did. [SPEAKER_E]: We know Mike is a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: I think we only. [SPEAKER_C]: Can prove her story true. That's true. I think he outed himself, which is huge. [SPEAKER_F]: I think we killed Mitch. [SPEAKER_E]: Who did you slap me with? [SPEAKER_C]: Paul? [SPEAKER_B]: I think we killed Justin. [SPEAKER_D]: I think we killed Justin. [SPEAKER_C]: I think we killed Justin, too. [SPEAKER_B]: I was the drunk. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, no. [SPEAKER_D]: I was the drunk. Paul's also lying. [SPEAKER_B]: No, I'm killing my. Okay, no, because I'm saying Mike is lying and Alicia's saying that. [SPEAKER_D]: No, we. [SPEAKER_B]: We killed Paul. [SPEAKER_D]: 100. I was the. [SPEAKER_C]: Is it Justin or Mike? [SPEAKER_D]: Why would. [SPEAKER_G]: I'm killing Mike. [SPEAKER_B]: Mike. [SPEAKER_G]: Time's up, everyone. [SPEAKER_C]: Three."}

[SPEAKER_B]: I did trade his card. [SPEAKER_E]: Still the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Sick. [SPEAKER_E]: Who did you trade it with? Were you? [SPEAKER_D]: No, I was not. [SPEAKER_B]: Who were you? [SPEAKER_D]: I was the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_B]: But I troublemade you. [SPEAKER_E]: With whom? [SPEAKER_B]: I don't want to reveal that half yet. [SPEAKER_D]: Here's the thing. Here's the craziest thing. Someone robbed from you, Mitchell. Robbed from you. Then you switched Mitch and I. Now I'm the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_B]: It's possible that could have happened. [SPEAKER_D]: Yes. [SPEAKER_B]: Who'd you rob? [SPEAKER_D]: I forget. Amnesia. [SPEAKER_B]: I forget who he is. [SPEAKER_D]: He hit himself really hard in the face after he did it. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, I forget who the other person I switched with. [SPEAKER_D]: So sure about you guys. Werewolves. Werewolves. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, werewolves. [SPEAKER_D]: A lot Dead. Oh, are we not. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, like. [SPEAKER_B]: No, no, no trouble. [SPEAKER_E]: Hey, Robert. [SPEAKER_C]: What? [SPEAKER_D]: I want to hear where they. [SPEAKER_C]: They are first. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Revealer. [SPEAKER_B]: You've seen revealer? Tanner or werewolf? You looked at Justin's. No, it was a Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: I said. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh my God. Okay, but you say if anyone. Okay, Justin. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, so she's the minion werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: If you. Okay, here's the thing. If you. If everyone tells me if I was robbed or troublemade and you tell me honestly, I will give you my full story. [SPEAKER_D]: I trouble made you. [SPEAKER_C]: I robbed you. I actually revealed your. [SPEAKER_A]: Go on Paul. [SPEAKER_D]: Full story, please. [SPEAKER_B]: I did not switch. Last one. I switched you with somebody. [SPEAKER_D]: Sick. [SPEAKER_B]: So sick. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you rob me? [SPEAKER_D]: No, I did. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you reveal me? [SPEAKER_B]: What? No, you're not revealed. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, werewolf buddies. [SPEAKER_C]: Hold on. I got. Sorry. You trouble made me. [SPEAKER_B]: I did 100%. [SPEAKER_C]: I troublemad you. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: I started as the Minion. [SPEAKER_B]: Why is Caitlyn helping Justin? [SPEAKER_D]: What? [SPEAKER_E]: I'm a started as the Minion. He's saying he troublemaked you. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, but I don't. [SPEAKER_B]: Would you trouble make. [SPEAKER_C]: Which is why I'm not giving up the werewolves yet. With who I. [SPEAKER_D]: Because I. I robbed from her. And I can verify that story. It is a revealer. [SPEAKER_E]: So you said werewolves, I believe. Because he said werewolves. He said. He said besides the trophy. He said I don't know if I've been switched. So I'm not giving up the werewolves yet. So I believe he actually was coming in and there's two werewolves. And I know for sure Justin was one of them. And now I'm starting to suspect he was because he was trying to throw shade off of Justin. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh my God. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm not trying to throw shade off Justin. I'm trying to put shade on Justin. [SPEAKER_D]: So that means we gotta kill Mike if I'm the Tanner. Or he could kill me. That's cool too. [SPEAKER_E]: Or maybe. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. Mike is getting weird. Okay, Mike is super weird. [SPEAKER_B]: I switched these. [SPEAKER_A]: Cause we're buddies. [SPEAKER_B]: I switched these two. 100%. I switched these. [SPEAKER_E]: So you switched. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, shit. All right, who's my werewolf friends that I need to protect? [SPEAKER_E]: Justin? [SPEAKER_D]: Mike, let's do this. [SPEAKER_B]: No, If I was a werewolf. That didn't happen. [SPEAKER_D]: You were. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, so you're not the Minion. [SPEAKER_A]: I still vote remaining you. [SPEAKER_C]: You saw what I saw. [SPEAKER_E]: Justin's card. It was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: So then we vote for Paul. [SPEAKER_E]: Unless I don't believe you. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, I don't believe Mike for a second. He's a werewolf. Yeah, I'm kind of iffy on Mike. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, we villagers we have to get on the same page here none of these three are really tell well you kind of confirm Caitlin's story yeah so these two are the bad so you. [SPEAKER_D]: Said you started as a minion? Yeah Then how did she see me as a tanner? [SPEAKER_A]: Mike explain that one only 30 seconds. [SPEAKER_B]: See I don't believe her as well. [SPEAKER_C]: I can't remember how I figured this out but I think we have to vote left because I think both the werewolves are in the middle and then it's just the minion and the tanner I think we got a vote left. [SPEAKER_E]: If there was two werewolves starting I. [SPEAKER_D]: Don'T think they're both you wouldn't have seen so who are we voting 10 seconds left is it Mike? That's what we can it's Paul or Justin It's Paul or Dustin I'm voting. [SPEAKER_C]: Mike It's Paul or Justin I'm actually the tanner TBH and I think we need to vote left no I think.

Robber, close your eyes. Witch, wake up. You may look at one of the center cards. If you do, you must exchange that card with any player's card. Witch, close your eyes. Troublemaker, wake up. You may exchange cards between two other players. Troublemaker, close your eyes. Insomniac, wake up and look at your card. Insomniac. Close your eyes. Everyone, wake up. [SPEAKER_B]: I had myself a little nap. [SPEAKER_C]: I almost didn't wake up. I was like sitting there like this and it was like insomniac, like oh shit, I gotta do something. It's the opposite of the insomniac. This is. This is what I want. [SPEAKER_D]: Just me. No. [SPEAKER_C]: What did you say? Oh, oh. [SPEAKER_D]: Queen the fifth. I don't want to incriminate myself. [SPEAKER_C]: Sounds good man. Just take the trolling. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, Just guess, Alicia. [SPEAKER_B]: What were you Lucy here? [SPEAKER_D]: Bang bang. Unless. Dang, Paul, things got worse for you pretty quick, huh? [SPEAKER_C]: Likely. Justin plays by himself. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, I'll just play everything Mike you robbed from. Okay, now let's start at the beginning. You looked at Mitchell and you saw that Mitchell was actually a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Cool. [SPEAKER_D]: Alright. Mike's not actually the robber. He's the troublemaker. Interact with Caitlyn. Paul's the robber because he's a little sneaky guy. He stole from Mitch, which is really cool. So now he's a werewolf, so he's being quiet, which is really cool. You switched us and I grabbed a Tanner for myself, which was a bad choice. And that's what we're left with. Vote for pole. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I'm almost willing to allow Tanner. I don't care. I have no info. I don't care. No, no. Cuz I was the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: All right, so we. We're two minutes down. Minion did a good job wasting time. [SPEAKER_B]: I am this year and I didn't. I looked at two from the middle. [SPEAKER_D]: Nice. [SPEAKER_C]: Good choice. [SPEAKER_D]: Good choice. [SPEAKER_B]: I didn't see any werewolves. [SPEAKER_D]: Spooky. What did you see? [SPEAKER_B]: A Minion. One of them. And I don't want to reveal the other one yet. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't know. So that I think. I think. No, I think this is. [SPEAKER_D]: No, no, no, no. I did grab myself the tanner. I was actually the troublemaker. No, you were not the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_B]: What are you saying? You were the witch. You said you were the witch and then you grabbed a tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: I grabbed a tanner and then told everybody. [SPEAKER_D]: Not necessarily from this one. I'm not giving that information. I just put it in the center to show. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay. Cause the other one that I saw was the witch, so I don't believe you. [SPEAKER_D]: That's a fair point, Rhett. I will plead the fifth. [SPEAKER_C]: What did you what? Sorry, what? [SPEAKER_B]: I said the two that I saw in the middle one was the minion. I didn't reveal the other one. And then he said he was the witch and stole the tanner. But the other one that I saw in the middle was the witch. [SPEAKER_D]: Who did you troublemake, Mitch? I didn't. He robbed the troublemaker. So you didn't troublemaker? No. Come on, don't bullshit me. [SPEAKER_C]: I think he's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: I didn't troublemake. [SPEAKER_C]: Only werewolves don't troublemake. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, troublemakers are only werewolves don't troublemaker. If a troublemaker don't troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_D]: Troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. So it's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Well. [SPEAKER_B]: What did you say? You said you were the troublemaker and you didn't do anything. [SPEAKER_D]: Correct. Come on. [SPEAKER_C]: No, no. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't buy it. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't buy it for one moment. [SPEAKER_D]: Or I just haven't given it up yet. But truthfully, I actually just didn't do it. [SPEAKER_C]: Doesn't look good for me right now. [SPEAKER_D]: I mean, I'm a witch. [SPEAKER_B]: Why wouldn't you? [SPEAKER_C]: Kate, it's one minute. [SPEAKER_B]: I didn't want too much switch. [SPEAKER_C]: I was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Left. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you troublemake me with anybody? He wasn't the troublemaker. Don't listen to him. I don't. Were you? No. Then how do you know that he wasn't in troublemaker? [SPEAKER_B]: What if Caleb, he's a tanner. I and she saw an insomniac in the middle. I think Paul would be the best player. Oh, my God. [SPEAKER_C]: Mike. Who did you rob? [SPEAKER_D]: Did you rob. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, did you rob me? Oh, Mike robbed me. Mike is the werewolf. That's what's happening? Yes. Did you trouble make me? [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_C]: Or did you trouble make Mike? [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_C]: Cause he wasn't. Cause you woke up with werewolves together? No, no. We vote make. I started as a werewolf by myself. Mike is. [SPEAKER_B]: I think he might be like the tanner or something. Or the minion and trying to. [SPEAKER_C]: So if he was the Minion, he wouldn't be. He'd be throwing me under the bus. Cause you. No, Justin, I get. I think. [SPEAKER_B]: But if you Dominion and you have the card and you get the Minion killed, he's. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, I am the tenor because I wished myself into it. [SPEAKER_B]: But I would know I didn't. Because you're not a witch. [SPEAKER_C]: But I would know. I'm Minion. I believe Alicia. I believe Alicia. [SPEAKER_D]: I also believe Alicia. I'm on Team Alicia, everyone. Elishman."}

I want to see if anyone else says it. Yeah, because I know if you know it, then. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, you robbed from him. [SPEAKER_E]: I did. [SPEAKER_C]: Cool. So we got three people on the team. So if I was to say what he is, then the three of us. [SPEAKER_D]: I robbed him. [SPEAKER_C]: Ooh, interesting. So then the question is, can you guys say what he is? [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Do you want to go? [SPEAKER_F]: You guys want to go at the same time? At the same time? [SPEAKER_A]: No, four of us. [SPEAKER_B]: No, not you. [SPEAKER_C]: You know what? You were the three of us. [SPEAKER_E]: This is. Nah, this is gonna fuck up. [SPEAKER_A]: Hold on. [SPEAKER_F]: So Alicia and I are the werewolves. [SPEAKER_A]: That's what we still be in the soccer. [SPEAKER_D]: Every one of us is lying. [SPEAKER_C]: I honestly don't think I should participate in. I think just those two because they're the only ones with conflicting stories. Sure. [SPEAKER_E]: What are you. [SPEAKER_C]: Obviously, I could get a. [SPEAKER_A]: Why. [SPEAKER_F]: Okay. I don't know where we're at at all. Is one of you claiming to be something, or are you just claiming to be able to confirm? [SPEAKER_A]: You said you were the seer. Seer looked at my car. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. So I know what he is. [SPEAKER_F]: Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: And they both said they robbed. [SPEAKER_F]: Okay. [SPEAKER_E]: Right, right, right, right, right. [SPEAKER_F]: All right. So on three, both of you say what Mike is. [SPEAKER_C]: Kay. [SPEAKER_F]: On three. He did say he was good okay, ready? [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, wait. I've got a better way to do this. Can we secretly hand you one of these instead of secrets? [SPEAKER_F]: No secrets. [SPEAKER_C]: No, it only supposed to be. [SPEAKER_D]: There's only one. I'm ready to say it out loud. Cause I'm not scared. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I just don't want. [SPEAKER_C]: All info has to be open. You're not allowed to see really bad. [SPEAKER_F]: I was just gonna be open. Because if one of you chooses the true one and the other person can't. [SPEAKER_A]: Choose the choice, if one of you hesitates, it's over. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, yeah. 100%. [SPEAKER_A]: You have to say it on three. [SPEAKER_F]: One, two, three. [SPEAKER_E]: Troublemaker. [SPEAKER_F]: You said which? [SPEAKER_D]: Mm. [SPEAKER_C]: So you and I know who's lying. [SPEAKER_A]: We know who's lying. [SPEAKER_E]: Perfect. [SPEAKER_C]: So what are you guys. [SPEAKER_E]: You're not gonna share that with us? [SPEAKER_C]: No, because they know who's lying too. We know which one of them is lying, so why don't we. There's three people who are good, which is really powerful and helpful. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: So you're saying you were the same. [SPEAKER_A]: Correct. [SPEAKER_E]: And that you saw it. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, and he saw my card, which was a good. [SPEAKER_C]: One of them said the correct answer, and one of them said the wrong answer. [SPEAKER_F]: I have nothing to offer. Interesting. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, interesting. Okay, okay, okay. And then Paul. Ah. [SPEAKER_E]: Did you wake up as the inside mania? [SPEAKER_C]: You need to guide this. [SPEAKER_A]: This. [SPEAKER_E]: This team. [SPEAKER_F]: Okay, so Mike was the troublemaker. And I believe you too. Yeah, I was the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_A]: So these two are werewolves. Or one of them is a Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: Who just switched, though. Please tell me it wasn't me. [SPEAKER_F]: He just said these two. [SPEAKER_A]: No, no, no. We know those two are the werewolves because Justin said the witch, and she. [SPEAKER_D]: Told her so in this location. Then you didn't switch, Caitlyn. [SPEAKER_A]: What do you mean? [SPEAKER_D]: Who did you switch? Put an end to it right now. [SPEAKER_A]: Actually, who I switch doesn't matter. In this situation. [SPEAKER_F]: It is if one of them is a minion. [SPEAKER_A]: No, I'm gonna say who I switch does not matter right now. [SPEAKER_C]: Trust him to the end zone. [SPEAKER_F]: I'm confused. [SPEAKER_A]: And specifically, I swapped Caitlyn and Mitchell. [SPEAKER_E]: Sweet. [SPEAKER_C]: So we vote. [SPEAKER_A]: But one of them's a Tanner one. [SPEAKER_F]: Oh, I understand. Because they were both good guys. [SPEAKER_C]: It kind of seems like Justin would be a Tanner being kind of brave about it. Going into that kind of a situation takes guts. Takes Tanner guts. [SPEAKER_F]: That makes sense. [SPEAKER_D]: But at the same time, would I be aggressive? Because you guys never vote for the person who's aggressive. Right? [SPEAKER_A]: That's true also. [SPEAKER_D]: So maybe I don't want you to kill me. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. So then we kill Alicia. [SPEAKER_F]: Oh, fuck. [SPEAKER_A]: This is a hard decision. [SPEAKER_F]: That's so tough. [SPEAKER_C]: I think we just go for Alicia. [SPEAKER_F]: Who did you rob from? [SPEAKER_A]: Mean. Also, one of them could be the Minion. It may not be. [SPEAKER_E]: It might be. [SPEAKER_A]: Not be Tanner. It could be this or it could be this. I don't think they're both. [SPEAKER_F]: I'm, like, relying entirely. [SPEAKER_C]: I think his actions show Tanner the most. [SPEAKER_A]: I'm kind of in. He could be pointing, trying to get us to think. [SPEAKER_F]: Either way. We don't want to vote for him, though. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, true. That's true. Yeah, but she, I mean, it could be the other way as well. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah, but I, I, she could just. [SPEAKER_D]: Be sitting and just enjoying this. A free Tanner kill. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah, that part. That's what makes me nervous, is that Alicia hasn't said anything. [SPEAKER_A]: I said she was the Tanner. She took the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: Seconds left. [SPEAKER_A]: Or the, the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm voting Alicia. [SPEAKER_A]: I think Vilicia's the better choice. You think? [SPEAKER_D]: Not just give her a Tanner kill. She's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: The fact that she did grab the troublemaker makes me think she might. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, she grabbed the troublemaker, the one I. [SPEAKER_E]: Shut up. Stop talking. [SPEAKER_F]: Do you think we would? Do you think we would? [SPEAKER_D]: We're obviously on different teams, her and I. [SPEAKER_A]: Obviously, she. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah, she. I feel like she hesitated when she grabbed that. Like, I think that was a werewolf move. I think Alicia's the best bet. [SPEAKER_B]: Time is up, everyone."}

[SPEAKER_C]: Oh, I said shut up. [SPEAKER_A]: Close your eyes. Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the minion can see who you are. Werewolves, put your thumb away.

[SPEAKER_D]: No. The minion is on the werewolf team. Team. [SPEAKER_F]: So if a villager dies and he doesn't die, he's basically a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Are you saying you're the troublemaker? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, but he's. [SPEAKER_B]: He's allowed to die on the werewolf team. It doesn't make the werewolves lose. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: So. Yeah, but in theory, there are no. [SPEAKER_E]: Werewolves in this scenario. You have to kill off a. Oh, okay, okay, okay. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah. So basically, you're a werewolf if you're the only one. [SPEAKER_C]: Hey, Paul's lying. [SPEAKER_D]: Why? [SPEAKER_C]: Because he's not a troublemaker? [SPEAKER_B]: Because you are. [SPEAKER_C]: Because I was. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, first of all, we know I'm not lying because I'm the troublemaker. Like, duh. [SPEAKER_C]: I'll tell you, I switched two cards. [SPEAKER_B]: Whoa. [SPEAKER_E]: Minion needs. [SPEAKER_F]: I was going to card. She said she switches two cards. [SPEAKER_C]: I switched two cards, and Paul's fucking lying. So he's a werewolf or he's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_F]: Honestly, he's bad. He's not good. [SPEAKER_D]: I am gonna let you in on a secret that I claimed troublemaker at the beginning of almost every single game. They can attest to that. [SPEAKER_E]: Sorry, I just was kind of dazed out. [SPEAKER_B]: What happened? [SPEAKER_E]: Sorry. [SPEAKER_C]: Paul grabbed the troublemaker and claimed he was a troublemaker. Isn't he? No, you're not. [SPEAKER_E]: Honestly, I'm really sorry. One more time. [SPEAKER_C]: Paul grabbed the troublemaker thing and claimed he was a troublemaker. I said, no, you're not. You're lying. Because I was the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: And she thinks she switched people and. [SPEAKER_C]: They switched two cards. [SPEAKER_D]: Gotcha. [SPEAKER_F]: Can we know one of the people? Actually, no. Let's wait on that. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_F]: Mike, what are you saying you did? [SPEAKER_B]: I looked at the 2 center. [SPEAKER_F]: What did you see? Let me guess, let me guess. Hunter. And we're okay. Oh, shit. I tried. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't want to give too much of that away because there is some that I could like something could come out. [SPEAKER_F]: All right, so that's three werewolves. [SPEAKER_D]: And did you see two of something on the same team? [SPEAKER_B]: No. [SPEAKER_F]: Oh, that's actually a question I think you can't answer. Is there a split? [SPEAKER_B]: There was not a split in what I looked at. [SPEAKER_F]: So it was either all good or all bad. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_F]: Roger dodger. [SPEAKER_C]: Mitch is a werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: Dang, Mitch. Carly, just how do you know both. [SPEAKER_D]: Of us are werewolves? [SPEAKER_C]: I don't. I. I know what you thought you were and I know what Mitch is now. [SPEAKER_F]: Whoa. I have no idea what's going on. [SPEAKER_D]: You switched me, Mitch. [SPEAKER_F]: Were you? [SPEAKER_B]: Were you? [SPEAKER_F]: My role does not matter. The hunter, potentially. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, it matters later down the road. So we don't vote for you and you kill somebody else off. [SPEAKER_F]: No, I think that's the way we do it. We get a cool kill where we figure out who the werewolf is. We vote for me as the hunter and I just sniped him with my fucking cool. [SPEAKER_E]: That's so sick. [SPEAKER_C]: Mitch is the werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: Sure, I'll vote for Mitch. Just kill me. [SPEAKER_E]: Go to time. [SPEAKER_D]: You think Mitch is a werewolf because you thought I started as a werewolf? Yeah, I started as a minion. [SPEAKER_F]: So, okay, so who did you troublemake? These two. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, so you started out as a minion. [SPEAKER_B]: You switched these two? [SPEAKER_C]: I switched those two. [SPEAKER_F]: So then I should vote for Paul and you guys kill me? [SPEAKER_D]: Are we on the same team? [SPEAKER_F]: Think about. [SPEAKER_B]: They're not. [SPEAKER_E]: No, we're not. [SPEAKER_F]: They're not. What did you see in the middle? [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, so Paul's a fucking liar. [SPEAKER_B]: One of them. [SPEAKER_F]: One of them's a fucking Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: One of them's a werewolf. One of them's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: What are you claiming to be one of them. [SPEAKER_E]: One's a fucking Tanner. I don't think we're on the same team, but I think it's in both our benefit to just shut the fuck. [SPEAKER_C]: Up from this point on. [SPEAKER_B]: That isn't until. One of them is where a hornsome tanner. 100%. [SPEAKER_E]: You know what? Yeah, yeah. Make your choice wisely. Sons of bitches. [SPEAKER_C]: I think Mitchell's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: Then that leaves why wasn't anyone revealed? If 1. [SPEAKER_B]: If the revealer would have been here then. [SPEAKER_F]: Oh, okay. [SPEAKER_B]: So. [SPEAKER_C]: So okay, this is what I think happened. I think it was this. And then I was a troublemaker, so I switched these. But Paul still thought it was this. That's why he said he was the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_B]: So, Mick, because Mitch was at the beginning of the game, what if we. [SPEAKER_C]: Just kill and then he's lying? Yeah. I don't know why we kill. [SPEAKER_F]: Mitch. [SPEAKER_D]: Are you claiming to be the hunter? Yeah, I was the hunter. I've been waiting for somebody to claim it. [SPEAKER_F]: I've been claiming it from the beginning. Now you're just jumping and now there's heat on you. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, so. Justin, there's no heat on him, right? There's something. [SPEAKER_C]: Paul is fucking with us. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I promise I'm not. Okay, but you switched me. [SPEAKER_F]: So you're aware of. [SPEAKER_A]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_E]: Honestly, Paul, I'm telling you. [SPEAKER_F]: Just that's why Mitch said say nothing. Cause now you're fucked. [SPEAKER_D]: Just. [SPEAKER_B]: I think we had to, you and. [SPEAKER_E]: I. I guarantee I was one of these. Okay? Okay, so now I know you can deduce which one I was. Because I know which one you were. And now both of us, we actually want the same person to do we do. [SPEAKER_F]: We do. We do. We only have six seconds. [SPEAKER_B]: No, because if I could just. [SPEAKER_F]: Quick, someone do a ricochet off me. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm gonna. [SPEAKER_F]: Locked and load it, killer. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm going for five. [SPEAKER_B]: Mitch. Mitch, no. [SPEAKER_E]: Don't want to kill both of us. [SPEAKER_C]: Everyone. [SPEAKER_D]: Three."}

I looked at yours. Okay. I definitely believe you're lying. Okay. Yeah. How do we proceed past this moment? We see what happens. Uh huh. Paul. First of all, let's just hear Paul's lies just to get the lie done. I stole the troublemaker one so he couldn't. Are you actually a troublemaker? I don't know. Am I? How's it feel, Paul? Your shirt's making me hungry. Who'd you switch? Who'd you switch? Thirsty? Yeah. Nice. Mike, did you look in the middle? No. You looked at a players? I did.

Okay, why don't we just all Conclude that Paul is just lying right now. Yeah, I mean, I'm not gonna believe anything you say. I absolutely know what your card is because I revealed it during the night. I looked at him. I don't know what's happening here. First of all, I just 100% know what's happen feeling I look at him. Mitch is the one that's lying. Told ya. I'm gonna stand by. It's me. If you troublemade me. So if I know I saw Tanner, if I am the only person in the ghost, I saw the Tanner there. What is happening? Can I actually claim my role now? Sure. Yes. As the troublemaker. This is great. And I made some trouble. All right. Would you call time and just kill me? Cause I'm fucking over it. I'm on your team, Paul. Let's figure this out. We can kill together, cry. You claim to be troublemaker, right? Yeah. So Paul wouldn't take it. So actually, the troublemaker. I don't know. Who'd you troublemake? Who had troublemake? I'm not saying that yet. It wasn't Paul, though. Paul still had one person. No, I'm fine with not knowing he's lived that lie because I know that he ate the troublemaker. That's the catch. What am I then? That's one. What am I then? I saw it. You're a Tanner. I'm a Tanner. No, I'm done. I'm the fucking troublemaker. You're the Tanner. You're the Tanner. And literally this is what happened. He's the Tanner. Tanner. Boom. We're actually like, oh, shit. I'm not. I'm cheating. Because you'll be doing this right now. Imagine if we were both wearing. So funny. Just get in a fight, waste the whole five minutes, and then fucking talk about it while you're doing it. How are you gonna get out of this hole? Well, I'm fucking with you on it, all right? I switched. I have nothing left. I'm d. I switched Carly with somebody, but not Paul. I'm fine with not knowing. To be honest, I want to vote for Mitchell. Should we say that? Who'd you switch me with? No, he's the Tanner. I. I switched you with Mike. You two have switched. Okay, you're saying I'm the Tanner or Mitch is the Tanner. I'm saying Justin's the Tanner. No, you have to believe you 100%. She's now the werewolf. Mitch is the other werewolf. Justin's a Tanner, and. What the fuck just happened? I think they're. I don't know what the fuck just happened.

Werewolves. [SPEAKER_B]: Caitlyn's a Were. [SPEAKER_A]: Corgi, Wake up and look for other werewolves. If there is only one werewolf, you may look at a card from the center. [SPEAKER_C]: Volume goes up again. [SPEAKER_A]: Close your eyes. [SPEAKER_D]: Let me know. [SPEAKER_A]: Minion, wake up. Werewolves, stick out your thumb so the minion can see who you are. Werewolves, put your thumb away. Minion, close your eyes. Apprentice Seer, wake up. You may look at one of the center cards. Apprentice Seer, close your eyes. Robber, wake up.

Troublemaker, close your eyes. Revealer, wake up. You may turn any other player's card face up. If the card you reveal is a werewolf or a Tanner, turn it back over face down. Revealer, close your eyes. Everyone, wake up. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, I was the revealer. [SPEAKER_E]: There was a bad person out there, and it was on this side of the table. [SPEAKER_C]: Awesome. I forgot who I was, but it wasn't a werewolf because that's all I. [SPEAKER_B]: Registered when I looked at my guy. [SPEAKER_C]: And set him down. So. [SPEAKER_B]: So you didn't do anything during the night phase? [SPEAKER_C]: No, I do not remember what I was. [SPEAKER_B]: So that means. Did you look at Mike? [SPEAKER_E]: I looked at Mike. [SPEAKER_B]: Was he a werewolf, Tanner, or. No, you. Minion comes. Was he werewolf or a Tanner? [SPEAKER_E]: He's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I was the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_E]: Prove it. I switched people. Your card isn't flipped up and I revealed it. Explain that. [SPEAKER_D]: I can explain that. Except for that you're bad and you're trying to make me look bad. [SPEAKER_B]: I was the little baby girl. And I looked in the middle because that's the little baby girl does. [SPEAKER_D]: What'd you see? [SPEAKER_C]: Could be weirded. [SPEAKER_E]: Way better. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm gonna leave that information to myself right now. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: Justin's being a jerk. And finally, coming from Mr. [SPEAKER_C]: Boy, who I. I fucked up. I'm not being a jerk. I'm not holding anything. [SPEAKER_D]: I robbed you. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay. Am I telling the truth? Yes. Because that's what little baby girls do. So this is what we're currently looking at. [SPEAKER_D]: I switched you, Mitch. [SPEAKER_E]: Cool. I don't believe you. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: So that means, James, you were the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I was the Troublemaker. So then 100%, I was the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_F]: Who did you switch Mitchell with then? [SPEAKER_D]: I switched Mitchell and Justin. [SPEAKER_B]: Cool. [SPEAKER_E]: I have 100% confidence that he's a werewolf, so I'm not afraid. [SPEAKER_D]: Like, I was the troublemaker. I was the only one doing switching last Night that could have possibly switched a bad role into somebody else. And I started. I started as a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_B]: That's the question of what James was. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm sorry, I can't control. [SPEAKER_B]: I think we just have to ignore him. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: And like assume that he's like just the Tanner or like one of the roles that maybe someone's lying about. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't know. Did anyone switch me? [SPEAKER_B]: Am I a werewolf? [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, then ignore me. I have nothing to contribute. What about you? [SPEAKER_B]: I saw werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: I think Mitch is bad because he's putting. So he's putting all this. [SPEAKER_E]: I 100% know who's bad. [SPEAKER_D]: I don't think you do. I think you're bad. And you saw the reveal in the center as the only werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Man, I get the angriest when you two lie to me. So like I should say to this. [SPEAKER_F]: Argument too, specifically these two. Justin, it's fine. [SPEAKER_C]: Because Mike looks me dead in the eyes and says I am this when I am that. And then Mitch laughs about it like it's a fucking game to lie to your friends. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, it is currently. [SPEAKER_C]: Shut up. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't know. [SPEAKER_D]: I. I switched you two. Which is strange. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm not worried about that. Cuz if I'm bad now I'm going to just vote for you. [SPEAKER_D]: That's fair. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: So. [SPEAKER_B]: So I'm going to just vote for you no matter what. That's easy for me. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, that's easy. [SPEAKER_B]: Voting for you no matter. [SPEAKER_E]: That's where I'm voting. [SPEAKER_D]: Friends, I think the rest of us. [SPEAKER_B]: I mean you, James, just vote left. [SPEAKER_D]: Don't roll it on, please. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, just vote. [SPEAKER_E]: We're all going to vote left. Sorry about. [SPEAKER_D]: I am not a werewolf. Not a werewolf. I am the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: I want to believe you, Mike, but more because I just want to kill Mitchell. [SPEAKER_D]: Or these two are both werewolves. Oh no. Cuz you Rob. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_F]: Confirm that. [SPEAKER_C]: Or are they both werewolves? [SPEAKER_D]: No, because I said I switched. Justin. [SPEAKER_C]: Justin saying you're a werewolf. Mitch is saying I should have paid attention. [SPEAKER_D]: So I'm not sure what's happening here. I'm not sure what's going on. [SPEAKER_E]: Or else it's kind of crystal clear. [SPEAKER_D]: Or else it's werewolf, werewolf, minion. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, maybe I was a minion. No, I don't know. [SPEAKER_B]: I saw a werewolf in the center. [SPEAKER_D]: I feel like I'm the only good guy. I'm the only good guy. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, James could be a good guy. [SPEAKER_D]: Not helping me at all. [SPEAKER_F]: James could be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: The fact that there's not a face up card helps nothing. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, I mean, I think it makes your stories. Believe me, it's a story because it's a bold thing to go on. [SPEAKER_E]: I was the first. [SPEAKER_D]: He said it first. But I think he was the only werewolf because you, if you. I mean, if you were the oppressor, you did see it. He saw Revealer in the center. [SPEAKER_C]: What happens if we kill two people, both die? Like, if Caitlyn votes for me, you guys vote for Mitch. And why are we voting for you? What? Well, because, whatever. I'm not gonna die. I'm just trying to even out the vote. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm voting for Mitch. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm voting 100%. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm voting for Mike. [SPEAKER_C]: You're voting for Mike? Caitlyn, you want to kill Mitch? Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: I am. Good. [SPEAKER_B]: James, you know your vote. Do you want to spend the 14 seconds? [SPEAKER_D]: Justin. Justin's voting me either way. [SPEAKER_B]: Yes. [SPEAKER_D]: Because no matter what, if he's bad because Mitch made because I switched them. [SPEAKER_B]: Then if you're bad, I win. It's just. [SPEAKER_D]: It's a win win for him. Your winning vote is Mitch. I'm saying it right now. [SPEAKER_A]: Everyone. [SPEAKER_F]: Three."}

[SPEAKER_C]: Robbed from James, robbed from Justin. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm a seer and I tattoo in the middle. [SPEAKER_D]: Here's where things get a bit fucking funky. No, because I was the robber and I can confirm Mitch was the seer. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, calm down. Just stay calm. [SPEAKER_D]: No need that. Right, so now I instinctively don't trust Kaitlin or Mike. Okay, so I'm not saying you guys are wrong, just that I don't trust you. But I believe Mitchell's story. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, but you robbed him. No, that's how you. Yes, yes. [SPEAKER_C]: So he's saying he robbed. [SPEAKER_B]: So he's saying Mitch is the robber now and you're the seer. [SPEAKER_D]: Yes. [SPEAKER_C]: I mean, I robbed you and you were the revealer again. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, that's wrong. [SPEAKER_C]: Why? [SPEAKER_E]: Because I saw some cards in the middle and one of which you're calling out these two werewolves. What are you doing, mate? [SPEAKER_D]: What are you doing, mate? I don't know. [SPEAKER_E]: I said that. Kibo. Katelyn, what are you doing too? [SPEAKER_D]: We have three robbers and I'm the only one, in my opinion. [SPEAKER_E]: So one of you guys is a Tanner, I'm guessing, and one of you is a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Or we have werewolf, werewolf, Minion. [SPEAKER_E]: Who's the minion? No, there's no one of these. Okay, Minions. One of the ones in the middle. [SPEAKER_B]: So you saw, in theory, a minion. [SPEAKER_C]: That's what he's saying. [SPEAKER_E]: What are you now still claim Robin, robber. [SPEAKER_D]: And you robbed from James. [SPEAKER_B]: James. [SPEAKER_D]: And you saw Revealer, so he must. I believe Mitchell even more now. And you're even more suspicious to me, James. [SPEAKER_E]: What are you. [SPEAKER_B]: Why? [SPEAKER_C]: Just cuz James isn't talking. I don't know why he's not talking. [SPEAKER_D]: Because he obviously wasn't the revealer. He would have said it first and then got mad if someone took it. [SPEAKER_B]: Shut up. I'm real confused and don't know what to do. [SPEAKER_E]: Remember, people can lie. Maybe that'll help. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: We didn't accidentally shuffle three robbers in I was a busy robber phase. We're just like cut here. Sir. [SPEAKER_C]: Good day. [SPEAKER_A]: Good day. [SPEAKER_C]: Who are you robbing? I'm robbing this. Okay, I won't rob that then. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: James, are you good or bad? [SPEAKER_E]: Just say that I'm good. [SPEAKER_D]: How so? Troublemaker. [SPEAKER_E]: Who'd you mix? Was it me? [SPEAKER_B]: Sure. [SPEAKER_D]: Fuck. [SPEAKER_C]: James. [SPEAKER_D]: Do you know what I think is the safest bet? Killing James. [SPEAKER_B]: Don't kill me. [SPEAKER_C]: I think the safest bet is Caitlyn. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I don't trust either of you guys. To the point that one of you. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, but if I'm. If we were both werewolves, why would I be throwing under the bus? [SPEAKER_D]: Because you're a Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: I think you are a Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, I think you are. [SPEAKER_E]: That's my guess. [SPEAKER_C]: So then vote for Caitlyn. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm not voting for Caitlyn. I'm voting for James. [SPEAKER_B]: Don't vote for me. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, that's what I think. James. I think. [SPEAKER_E]: James, you need to help us out. [SPEAKER_B]: Hold on, hold on. Let me. Okay, so why is everyone a robber? That's why I'm so confused. [SPEAKER_C]: I was a robbery. [SPEAKER_E]: That's it. [SPEAKER_B]: Remember? [SPEAKER_D]: I robbed from Mitchell. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Yes. [SPEAKER_B]: And you're saying. [SPEAKER_D]: I believe. I'm just confirming his story. And he saw. He saw these in the center. [SPEAKER_B]: And. Mitch, can you. Okay, you can't confirm. [SPEAKER_D]: Anybody else? [SPEAKER_B]: Caitlyn? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: You're saying what, that I'm a robber? [SPEAKER_B]: And you robbed from who? [SPEAKER_C]: Justin. [SPEAKER_B]: And it's a must, not a me. [SPEAKER_D]: What was I? [SPEAKER_C]: You were a robber. What? [SPEAKER_D]: That was worth it. So then. And you said you were off from James and you made. [SPEAKER_C]: He was a Tanner man. [SPEAKER_D]: You were a Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: James. [SPEAKER_D]: Who'd you switch? [SPEAKER_C]: Trying to up. Didn't work. Tired of being a Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, I. I don't know what to do. [SPEAKER_E]: Name one of the people you switched. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, I was a werewolf. I don't know what happened. [SPEAKER_D]: Did anyone interact with James's card? I see. So then all three of them are bad. Why are you saying a werewolf? [SPEAKER_C]: I think Caitlyn's a safe boat. [SPEAKER_D]: I was the robber. [SPEAKER_C]: I think Caitlin's a safe boat. [SPEAKER_D]: I think one of you guys are both playing Tanner. Werewolf interference. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't know why he's saying werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Because I'm so confused. [SPEAKER_D]: I don't know what to do. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't know what happened. No fucking idea. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm hoping I admit this and someone's. [SPEAKER_C]: Like, I'm gonna tell you right Now, I am 100% the tanner. So it can't be Caitlin. So she's playing the heavy. [SPEAKER_B]: You didn't see. You saw Minion in the center. [SPEAKER_A]: Only 30 seconds left, man. [SPEAKER_E]: Now. Now I'm worried that you, like, robbed from a werewolf, and now you're throwing. I feel like. I know. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm sorry. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm just gonna throw you under the bus, Mike, because I don't know what's happening here. [SPEAKER_D]: You woke up at night. [SPEAKER_B]: What? [SPEAKER_D]: What? [SPEAKER_B]: Me and Mike are werewolves. Okay, so who interacted with us? [SPEAKER_D]: Nobody. [SPEAKER_B]: And you're not a Minion because you saw a minion. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, and I robbed from Mitch Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, let's not confuse me this bad again. [SPEAKER_E]: So we vote James Justin 3. [SPEAKER_D]: Let's vote."}

[SPEAKER_B]: Obviously something not good. [SPEAKER_C]: Clearly. Who was it? [SPEAKER_B]: I'm gonna leave it close to my chest for right now. [SPEAKER_A]: One of you two is lying. [SPEAKER_C]: U.S. too. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. One of you two is lying. [SPEAKER_C]: What if it's both it? I can't send the tension. [SPEAKER_A]: James is also lying. [SPEAKER_E]: Because you're Troublemaker. [SPEAKER_A]: No, I was Seer and I saw Troublemaker in the center. [SPEAKER_C]: Checks out. [SPEAKER_A]: No, not there though. [SPEAKER_B]: I looked at Mike's card. [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_B]: Yep. You might have been something good when you went to bed, but you're not good when you woke up. [SPEAKER_A]: It's me with fucking two werewolves, a Tanner and a Minion. No, that's not true. Because I saw werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm not saying that I like that. Doesn't make me bad. I'm just saying something might have happened that made you bad overnight. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, but I saw troublemaker though. [SPEAKER_B]: So? And it can't be because a robber. [SPEAKER_A]: No, robber can't. I'd be robber then. [SPEAKER_C]: Nah, Mike's lying. [SPEAKER_A]: Wait, no. [SPEAKER_C]: So you should be a Revealer now because you rob? [SPEAKER_E]: Correct. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: So what the fuck are you. Caitlin, you're not claiming anything. [SPEAKER_B]: It's a good preparation for it was taken from me. This is good preparation. [SPEAKER_C]: What? Yeah. 100%. [SPEAKER_B]: Heck yeah. This is the place to be if you like board games. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, Mike, I'm trying not to get shouty. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't know why James, that you're. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't know why you're. [SPEAKER_A]: You're bad. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't know why you're being a dankus. I'm being a danker. Well, hold on. [SPEAKER_A]: Whoa. [SPEAKER_E]: James is barely making it through. What's happening? [SPEAKER_C]: Hold on. [SPEAKER_A]: Think. Nope. [SPEAKER_C]: Hold on. Oh, wait, that doesn't check. Oh, no. Oh, hold on, hold on. Just let me. Let me present. [SPEAKER_B]: We have to let people touch. [SPEAKER_C]: Let me present. Let me present. Let me present. [SPEAKER_A]: No. [SPEAKER_C]: So what the are you kids? [SPEAKER_E]: Everyone roll to something different. [SPEAKER_A]: He's just guessing. [SPEAKER_C]: No, no, no, it checks out, cuz you two are on board with each other. Caitlyn's at odds. So she's a fucking Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: Caitlyn's not at odds. [SPEAKER_C]: What? No, Caitlyn's like not really claiming anything. [SPEAKER_A]: So she claimed troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: So she's. Well, I don't think she's troublemaker. She's not. [SPEAKER_A]: Cause I saw it in the center. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, why are we just taking Mike's word as gossip? [SPEAKER_C]: Hold on, hold on, hold on. Okay. [SPEAKER_A]: Cause I think it's. [SPEAKER_C]: His eyes got so big when you said that. Like what? Fuck you. No one can swap with the center. Hey, no, no. That doesn't make sense then because that's what I saw. So you two had. [SPEAKER_B]: So you're saying you're the seer? [SPEAKER_C]: I am the seer. [SPEAKER_B]: So Mike's saying he's the seer? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, no, no, but. So I'm just trying to catch what. How you can confirm you can. You robbed him? [SPEAKER_A]: Yes, I believe I. [SPEAKER_C]: So you're a werewolf now? [SPEAKER_E]: No, incorrect. You're off by something here. I don't know what it is. I'm on your side. I want you to figure it out. But he was a revealer. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't know why you. [SPEAKER_C]: Because you can. You are the only two confirming your. I'm against him. You're confirming Mike's card as bad as bad. Yeah, and which is wrong. [SPEAKER_A]: He was. [SPEAKER_C]: What the fuck did you say that made me think. What? What was it? Oh my God. [SPEAKER_A]: I think it's that and this is the. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I. No, that isn't correct. [SPEAKER_A]: I think. And I think Justin robbed from a werewolf. No, I was pointing me under the bus. [SPEAKER_C]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. These two are werewolves. These two are werewolves. [SPEAKER_A]: I'm not. [SPEAKER_C]: These two are werewolves. [SPEAKER_A]: No, because we're against each other. He's throwing me under the bus. I'm throwing him under the bus. [SPEAKER_B]: Werewolf strategy. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, man. [SPEAKER_A]: No. [SPEAKER_E]: Who are we voting for? [SPEAKER_C]: Who's the real revealer? [SPEAKER_A]: Nobody was. It was. Justin was definitely the revealer. [SPEAKER_E]: And I'm on your side. [SPEAKER_B]: And I saw werewolf on Mike. No, he's saying he's the seer too. That's just like he. He's saying he's the seer. Are you the seer? [SPEAKER_A]: Yes. [SPEAKER_C]: Then it's. [SPEAKER_A]: Then it's Mike. No. [SPEAKER_B]: Cause I saw a werewolf when I flipped him over. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. [SPEAKER_A]: No, you can't. You. No. [SPEAKER_C]: So we're voting Mike. [SPEAKER_B]: Yes. [SPEAKER_A]: Yes. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. [SPEAKER_A]: No. You weren't the troublemaker. I was the here. I'm the only good one who did you troublemaker. No one's asking. I can't be the only good one. There's a. [SPEAKER_D]: Time is up. [SPEAKER_A]: There's a robber that robbed a werewolf and a werewolf doesn't think this is what this is."}

Excuse me, Mike, I thought the drunk doesn't look. No, sorry. I grabbed that one. I didn't look at it. How. Hello, I'm gonna say I was the seer. I saw two good things in the middle. So there is two words. I don't believe you're the seer for a second. Because I was El Ciro. Okay, so we got two seers, two drugs. James, work out the riddle. Rich. That's very strong. Is something. But I didn't. Okay. Were you distracted with kneezees? What? No, I just was like meh. Fuck it. I don't know how you do it. Fuck. Cause I was gonna say you could confirm my serious story. Cause I saw stuff in the center, but whatever. Sorry. Alright, well, okay. So what did you see in the center? We'll just go with this. I want to know what you saw in the center. Okay, I saw. Let's say what we saw right here. Whoa. That's the one I took. Horseshit. I took this one. No. And you were the drunk. Yes. And you don't get to look at that. No. Why do you want to say you're also the drunk? Why do I also want to say that? I was the drunk because when at the beginning of the game. You know that part where you all. Because he's a Tanner. No, no, no. But he's a Tanner and he wants to be. What's your motivation for trying to steal someone else's identity? Troublemaker? Goddamn werewolf or a Tanner. That's not what I saw. That's not you. I would drunk anything. I didn't. I looked at these two. I don't know what you're talking about. Okay, let's read 1, 2, 3. Robert. Oh no. He was the robber though. So we're gonna go with that. That's what she's. Oh, so I'm good now. So I don't. Which one did you take initial? I took the middle one. This one? Yeah. That was a Tanner. Nope. Cause he just said that he looked at these things. Mike, I'm lying to get you just give more information that's false so we figure out what you actually are. Ok. These two are so suspicious. Yeah, these two are so suspicious. What are you talking about? We have two Sears and we have two drunks. So of course they're. I think these two are the most. I absolutely am feeling the same thing. Justin's eyes get this large and his voice gets that high pitched when he's lying. It's one of those things that, I mean like you guys. It's obvious for you guys to say that. Cause you guys are the coin flip of Mitch and I. Yeah. So I think we killed Justin because Mitchell is clearly the Tanner. And I think we kill Mike. No. And I think, I think we kill Mike because she's clear the Tanner and wants to die. Huh? James. James. You are the witch. I believe you. This is your responsibility. But he didn't do his ability. Which is fucked. It was dumb. After we decided. Yeah. You should always do your. We gotta vote for J. We gotta vote for Justin. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Why not? No, no, no. Cause. Hold on. Okay. Him and I have been friends. I'm still stuck on this we're both drunk thing. Cause why are. Zoe, Can I ask a question? James, do you wanna. Would you rather vote for someone between Mike and I or someone between Mitch and Caitlin? Uh, I'm feeling Mitch and Caitlin. What? I'm gonna get on this train then, then. I like that. But we have to vote for Mitch then I, I. You absolutely have to vote for Caitlyn. No, stop. You said you were the eyes of me. Yes, and so you were the drunk. You're the. So why did we kill Her. You. You were the bad guy. But you saw the card. You saw the card I put. Here's my theory. Here's my theory. Cause he said he was a seer. Oh, you saw a tanner. I didn't see a tanner. You saw a tanner. And you said you saw a witch here. But I'm a goddamn witch. Okay, but Mike's saying he saw a robber here and these two fuckers are fighting over drunk. So I think we actually. So I think. You know what the correct answer is in this. I think it's Caitlin. I agree. It's Caitlin. No, it's not Caitlin. Cuz Caitlin is on my Is. Why? Why are you picking Caitlyn over me? We're both calling drunk. I think. What is it that. I think it's you two, because I know that we know that it's you two. It's. You know. How does he know out of which drunk is real? I think. Okay. I personally don't think we can vote on the drunk. And you guys should just kill me, I think. Huh? No, no, no. Okay. Fuck you. Wait, wait, wait. I would be a full proponent of it. He's jumping 100% to kill Justin. Yeah. Kill Justin. Yeah. Not a chance. Yes, a chance. I just. I just don't think we should kill one of the drunks. You either kill me or Mike. And if I'm if thing on the tanner, don't kill me. Kill Mike. I'm totally. I think the tanner was here. So then we don't want to do anything with the drunks. Yes. So we want to kill you. Or we're killing Mike, so we're killing Justin. Wait, what? Kill the fake seer? Whichever. Seer's fake. Yeah, we're gonna kill whichever sear is fake between Mike and I. Justin, let's go like this. Okay, hold on. Kissy face. No, no, no, no, no. Yeah, it's one. It's me or Justin. Like this whole situation. It's me or Justin. You have to kill one of us. Yeah, but you're the fucking Tanner. Maybe I am. So maybe then vote for Mike. We just can't vote for the drunk. The drunk's too crazy. He took a villager out. That's all it is. We have to kill me or Mike. Yeah, when a werewolf can look center, can't he? Yeah, if there's only one. Three, two."}

I need to know if there's a drunk. I got a scythor star. You magic. I was the drunk. I saw two werewolves in the center. Oh, Jesus. I saw two werewolves in the center. What did I do? What were you, Paul? I'm guessing. I really. Or you could be Tanner, too. Is it just me or is it me? I don't want to say what I am either. Sure. Sounds good. You're not one of these two, because Mitch is either one of these two. Which one did you choose? What else could I be? I don't know which one I chose. What else could I be, though? I'm just here to wreck your werewolf game. Classic binary company. Oh. What were you, Justin? I was a robber. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Can you confirm anyone's right? I can confirm Mitch was the drunk. Sorry, Mitch. Rip. Rip. This is what's up. You're one of these two. We vote for Mitch. That's our best chance. So you're not the Tanner? No. Troublemaker. Mike, you really looked at two cards in center. I really looked at two cards in center. It was two werewolves. Which one did you switch with? 100%. I don't wanna say. No, man, you gotta. I don't want him. Either you're the Tanner or a werewolf. Yeah, well, here's the thing. He actually wasn't the drunk. Oh, shit. He could be. No, he's not the Tanner. Yeah, he's not the Tanner. Yeah, we vote for Mitch. No, we don't. Okay. What was he? I was the drunk. Why did you call drunk? Because I was the drunk. He's the Tanner. I Was the drunk. I think he's the. No, here's the thing. No. No way. He said he's the tanner. Justin's the tanner. I was the drunk. I swear to you. Mitch is the tanner. Look at me in the fucking eyes, you liar. From the moment he asked who's the drunk? I said, you came out of the drunk. He was coming with bad news, and you're like, perfect. I didn't. Who is in the middle? Why? Because, you know, odds are I'm a werewolf, he's a tanner. We cannot vote for. He wants us to vote for him right now. Yeah. Okay, if you were the drunk, which one did you choose? Just. Just point the one out. No. And then hear me out. Why? I won't do it. Because either I'm a werewolf. You say I'm a werewolf, you kill me. I lose. Or I'm a tanner, you vote for someone else. I lose. So you're not the tanner if I voted. Oh, hey, that's a good point. Why do you say he's not the tanner? Yeah, because I know you're the tanner. Why? Hundred percent I believe you. If you were the drunk, you pointed a card in the center. I'm not gonna do that. Either way from team drunk. Team drunk. We're both drunk. You are 66% chance of werewolf 32%. What if one of these. You're saying you were the drunk? Yes. He hundreds and wasn't. What if he robbed? I wanna be Paula James. Friend creep. If he's a glass of wine. I don't think he would do that. He wouldn't be fighting like this. Phaedra, we will always be friends. Friends of life. Life we are. Wish granted. We can't kill Mitch. We can't kill Mitchell. And he's gonna say we can't kill. He's gonna say you're cannot kill the tanner. But don't vote for me either. Don't vote for him. Do not vote for me. Who would you vote for? Sorry? Who are you? Yeah, you haven't said anything. You. Yeah, I know everything that's going on. And who then say I'm gonna vote for Paul. Vote for Mitch. I'll vote for Paul. Vote for. Yeah, I'll vote for Paul. Mike, we have to vote for Mitch. I'll vote for. Why? I need to know why. Who are you voting for? Mike. Another minute. Why? Why are you sucking at me? Suck at Justin. I need to know why. I need. If you're really a villager. And we need to know all our stories. One minute remaining. Makes sense. Justin's life. Four times. Twice. Twice. Four times. Four times. Once when I said I was the robber and once when I said he was the drunk. Okay, after that, I told the two. I robbed you. You're 100% this year. I was the robber. Okay, that checks out because I was. I believe you. Mitch is in here 100%. He wasn't. He's trying to take my. How do you feel about this? How do you feel about this? Will you tell me what card you chose and will you tell me what card is safe? Like, secretly? No, you can't have. Only 30 seconds left, so I just want to know which card you pointed at. I'm not gonna say. Okay, Paul, we have. It's. Mitch is our best option. Justin is totally a Tanner. Don't screw this versus a Tanner. I'm not a Tanner. I am probably a werewolf because I was the drunk. I don't know why you're arguing that you are the drunk and someone else is taking well. No, I want to be careful that we don't. Don't vote for Tanner. And I'm praying I'm a troublemaker or something. I'm. Time is up, everyone. Three."}

[SPEAKER_B]: Because I was the drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: But not this again. Because I saw a drunk. That would literally be the same as last round. I saw a drunk. You. Neither of you are drunk. That is true. [SPEAKER_B]: Neither of us are the drunk. I was just kidding. Yeah, no, I was just also. Just. [SPEAKER_C]: What are you, though? [SPEAKER_B]: What am I? Did you switch me with someone? [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, possibly. [SPEAKER_B]: I was the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: You revved me. [SPEAKER_B]: I switched Justin with Paul. [SPEAKER_C]: Now I'm the werewolf, aren't I? [SPEAKER_B]: No, you're a Tanner. I was a Tanner. Cuz I feel like Mitch wouldn't lie about who he switched with. He doesn't pull Paul's like Paul does. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, I totally switching. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh. [SPEAKER_C]: Got me. Maybe you do. Maybe I didn't. Maybe I didn't. Maybe you're a fucking lying piece of secret. But he confirmed my story. Yeah, but. [SPEAKER_B]: No, I don't like that. But these two are confirming stories. [SPEAKER_C]: That's fair. But you came out as the Tanner. I'm the night witch. So I wasn't a werewolf. I can 100% guarantee that one. Um, I can't. You have Tantan. I shouldn't do that. Who'd you steal from me? He confirmed my story. [SPEAKER_B]: He confirmed your story. But there's no one confirming his story. [SPEAKER_C]: So he. [SPEAKER_B]: If he said it first. [SPEAKER_C]: I did say before Mike said. I said, there is a seer out there and I know who it is. I know I did say that much. [SPEAKER_B]: That was on how I played it back in my memory. [SPEAKER_C]: When I looked back on it, that is what happened. You literally said, is there a seer? I want to know if there's a seer out there because you want to know when I said, I know who it is. [SPEAKER_B]: No, Mitchell was reciting Shakespeare. [SPEAKER_C]: You're bullshit. Okay? I think either they're both werewolves or. No, I. I think he. He is like, we're not both werewolves. Because I say, vote for Justin. I honestly don't know how. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm cool. [SPEAKER_C]: You guys vote for me, don't vote for Justin. I think Mitch is the werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't think Mitch is the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: I might have all heard that. [SPEAKER_B]: Because Mitch, I just don't trust. I don't trust you two boys. [SPEAKER_C]: That's fair. We know each other. We're on the same team. Yeah, to us, we're not boys. Why do you trust him? Because I do trust you. But why? Well, because he came out right away and he's like, there's a. Did you. [SPEAKER_B]: I've done that before. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, he came out of time. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, that's. That's a. [SPEAKER_C]: First person talk isn't always the most truthiest. Well, Justin was the first one first. Give a little bit of like. I appreciate that. What I said wasn't really that confirming of anything, but I did give fucking. It wasn't Shakespeare, but I did say I know there's a seer out there, and I really wanted to tell you guys who it was before they coped to it, so I could build that trust. But Mike didn't really give me that opportunity. Sorry. So you still trust him? Mike? Yeah, I still trust him. What percentage? 100. Well, if. If he's. If he's not telling the truth, then you were the robber or he was. [SPEAKER_B]: The robber and he took a werewolf from Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, but then Mitchell wouldn't know that. [SPEAKER_B]: Mitchell wouldn't know that, but that's what he's trying to, you know, get heat on him. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't really think he was actually a robber to begin with. Why are you trying to put heat on me? Shit. What if they're both werewolves? [SPEAKER_B]: That could be a thing. I wouldn't. [SPEAKER_C]: I wouldn't want to put heat on. Okay, Mike, you need to stop paying attention to Mitchell because he's clearly poisoning your mind. It's just he has I definitely am on your team. [SPEAKER_B]: He has an unconfirmed story. Totally unconfirmed. [SPEAKER_C]: Not totally unconverted. Kill me. Kill me. I think they might both be werewolves. I would be totally killed. Well, I'm not. That's what I think he's doing. [SPEAKER_B]: Kill me. [SPEAKER_A]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_C]: But Justin could literally try to be, like, making us vote for Mitch so that we don't. They don't really seem to be working together. Well, I know they cut. I don't know him. [SPEAKER_B]: We kill Mike. [SPEAKER_C]: I think the safer bet is I. [SPEAKER_B]: Think we all three of us vote for Mike. I think hear me out on this. [SPEAKER_C]: Safer bet is to kill because he already came out as a Tanner when he thought you got switched. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes. Yes. Yeah. I think Paul is fucking with you. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, man. Let the car flip."}

Did anyone see that I was the werewolf? No. [SPEAKER_D]: Great. [SPEAKER_C]: I was the seer. I looked at two in the middle. [SPEAKER_B]: Nice. Okay, that's important because there is a drunk at the table. I can confirm that he was the drunk. I was the robber, and I stole from him. [SPEAKER_D]: Nice. [SPEAKER_C]: What I'm worried is that we kill Mike. I'm worried that we kill Mike too. Like, it could just happen. Well, if this is. [SPEAKER_D]: Don't even realize if this is right.

[SPEAKER_D]: But who did you switch? Yeah, who did I switch? Yeah, I switched you with somebody. Uh huh. Yeah, I did. 100%. [SPEAKER_C]: Don't believe me? [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, you did what? I switched him with somebody. [SPEAKER_B]: Nice. High five. [SPEAKER_C]: No, this is not good. Why? [SPEAKER_D]: Why? What are you. [SPEAKER_C]: No. Well, I was the seer. [SPEAKER_D]: Is someone lying? [SPEAKER_B]: Did you see troublemaker in the center? [SPEAKER_D]: Someone lying at this table? [SPEAKER_C]: No, I did not see troublemaker in the center. No, I don't think anyone's lying, but I only saw two of these in the middle, which tells me there's a third one out there. And I Just don't want to be that third. I don't want to end up that third.

[SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I look, I looked at that one. That was one of them I looked at. [SPEAKER_D]: What was that one? [SPEAKER_B]: I think. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, that was a werewolf. Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: I think we have to kill Paul now. [SPEAKER_C]: It's 50. [SPEAKER_D]: 50, 50. [SPEAKER_B]: But I. I don't believe a drunk afterwards. [SPEAKER_D]: Does it matter? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: You can just tell him who you swapped him with. We need to get his trust. [SPEAKER_D]: Something with you. [SPEAKER_B]: I was the drunk at that point. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: I was the. Yeah, I was the drunk at that point. [SPEAKER_C]: Yep. [SPEAKER_D]: So you should have the drunk now. [SPEAKER_C]: Sounds good. Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Were you Check. So everyone was actually the rules, like. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm cool with you voting for me. [SPEAKER_D]: Too because it's 50. [SPEAKER_C]: 50 chance I win regardless. [SPEAKER_B]: I think we have to kill Paul. I think so too. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. I'd be down. Are you down? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. 50. 50 chance. [SPEAKER_C]: Sounds good.

[SPEAKER_E]: They will just. You turn it on. [SPEAKER_C]: I didn't know you could turn it off. Just wing it. Just wing it, man. We'll go at seven minutes. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Set a timer for four minutes and 40 seconds. [SPEAKER_B]: Is she gonna tell us when there's one minute remaining? [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_B]: Come on. Who was it? [SPEAKER_C]: I, I. Maybe I'm on his team. There's two werewolves out there. [SPEAKER_B]: Nah. You want to claim Revealer? [SPEAKER_C]: It was Mitch. It was 100% Mitch. [SPEAKER_B]: So no one switched with you, Paul, what were you? [SPEAKER_D]: I was a trollmaker. [SPEAKER_B]: Who did you switch? [SPEAKER_D]: I switched you with somebody. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Who you switching with? Not Mitch. [SPEAKER_D]: Not Mike. [SPEAKER_B]: With Mike. Cool. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, I looked after, so, I mean, unless you were a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: What were you just saying? [SPEAKER_B]: I don't want to say yet. [SPEAKER_C]: I think he was the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: No, I looked in the middle. [SPEAKER_D]: What'd you see? [SPEAKER_B]: I saw a Tanner and another werewolf. Mitch was by himself. He woke up. These are the ones that I say I saw. Where? Um. What'd you see in the middle? [SPEAKER_C]: Probably another werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: I didn't look in the middle, to be honest. [SPEAKER_B]: So you had another werewolf with you? [SPEAKER_E]: That's not true. [SPEAKER_B]: What did you do then? [SPEAKER_E]: I'm just gonna leave it at that. [SPEAKER_B]: Sure. It's spicy. [SPEAKER_D]: So we just vote Bench. [SPEAKER_C]: I mean, he's a guaranteed bed. Unless there's a second. I think there's a second werewolf out there, but I don't know what they're thinking. [SPEAKER_B]: Would it be pool? [SPEAKER_C]: It might be. [SPEAKER_D]: It would be literally any of the three of us. Because nothing can be confirmed. [SPEAKER_C]: I mean, Mitch can confirm mine. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, I mean, I believe Mike. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, that's kind of fair. Mmm. [SPEAKER_C]: Because even if we were werewolves together, I wouldn't be throwing him under the bus this hard. [SPEAKER_B]: Unless they're doing, like, this weird. No, because then if they're werewolves, they couldn't be working together on this. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: And if you switched us, Mike would be saying something. So did you truly switch us? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, then, yeah, I was the revealer. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. I was a seer. [SPEAKER_C]: So, Liz, you're also bad. [SPEAKER_D]: What if one of you is the tanner? [SPEAKER_B]: Well, so, for example, if I was the tanner. I don't care anymore. I'm on the villagers team because Mike's now a tanner. But I wasn't. [SPEAKER_C]: I was a seer, and I was a revealer, and I looked at Mitch's card, and it was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. So I. I mean, I'm good to vote for Mitch. [SPEAKER_D]: This is falling too closely, easily into place. [SPEAKER_B]: What is there to modify? Right. Like, you're the only one who modifies. Mike can confirm. I think. [SPEAKER_C]: I think when I think. I think. I think when I had said that I looked at somebody and was a werewolf, Mitch was just like, well, I'm the only werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: And he took a limb, hoping that he got troublemade, but he didn't. So now he's just himself. It should be a bit of a bummer. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: What's the timer like? [SPEAKER_E]: I think you were the one before. [SPEAKER_B]: What do you think? You think I stole from you? [SPEAKER_C]: No, I looked last. [SPEAKER_E]: I don't. I don't think he stole from me. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, that's what I'm. I'm concerned that one of you might have robbed from Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: No, but I look last. [SPEAKER_B]: So then if anything, it's Mike. [SPEAKER_D]: No, but I'm lying. [SPEAKER_C]: If I could have. Yeah. You know, he's right. The scenario could have been I was the robber. I picked his card up and was like, oh, I'm a werewolf now That's a possibility. [SPEAKER_B]: I think that's too big of a play for us to do on our first game of Werewolves for the night. We have to work into that. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I'm not trying to say, like, that's what happened. [SPEAKER_C]: No, no, but it's a fair scenario. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't think it happened, though. [SPEAKER_C]: I was definitely a Revealer. That's a good strategy, though. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm thinking if you switched Mitchell with something and have more of a game, but because you switched us, nothing has happened. [SPEAKER_D]: I think you might be the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: But if I was a Tanner, like I said, I don't care. [SPEAKER_C]: Because you switched them. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. Then I'm now a villager. [SPEAKER_D]: But then why. [SPEAKER_C]: But he has. He's not throwing himself. He's not even. Well, because. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, like, he would have come out. [SPEAKER_C]: And said, I'm the Tanner then. Because if you did the switch. Right. [SPEAKER_E]: I know now's the part of your troublemaker role where you tell us who you actually switch. [SPEAKER_B]: No, that. [SPEAKER_D]: But that's why I actually switched. That's why I'm like, shit. [SPEAKER_B]: But what's wrong with. So if I was a Tanner, I don't care anymore. Right. Because you switched me. But I was. Were you, though? No, I was a seer. Like, why does it matter if I'm no longer what I was? [SPEAKER_C]: I think we are at 20 seconds. 20 seconds. [SPEAKER_B]: How's it going, Atom? Kraftsberg. [SPEAKER_C]: Good morning. Good evening. [SPEAKER_B]: I think we just killed Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: I think we killed Mitchell. [SPEAKER_B]: What? Everything points to the most. [SPEAKER_E]: I have no last words. [SPEAKER_B]: And you were the revealer, and you saw him. [SPEAKER_C]: I saw him 100%. [SPEAKER_D]: I think we should go for Mike. [SPEAKER_C]: Why? [SPEAKER_D]: I just have a feeling. [SPEAKER_E]: Agreed. [SPEAKER_D]: Three, two."}

I troublemade you both back. [SPEAKER_B]: Nice. [SPEAKER_C]: Should we go to a vote? [SPEAKER_B]: Sure. [SPEAKER_C]: Can you confirm any of it? [SPEAKER_B]: I was a werewolf who got cold feet for, like, a sec, and I was like, nah, I'm werewolf Mike. [SPEAKER_C]: Any contribution? Tanner? Okay, I called it all. Calling it. Now we can go to vote. [SPEAKER_D]: So who do we kill? Paul, I don't think that's true. [SPEAKER_C]: Can you confirm any of it? [SPEAKER_E]: Were you actually the troublemaker? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: And you switched them, too? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Sick. Okay. Sick, sick, sick. [SPEAKER_E]: All right. [SPEAKER_D]: I was a sear. I was not the robber. [SPEAKER_B]: I saw that. [SPEAKER_C]: I was not the robber. [SPEAKER_E]: I looked at myself. [SPEAKER_D]: Mike, where were you besides the Tanner? Because we know that's what you were. [SPEAKER_B]: I was actually the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: Spicy. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, you robbed. I had it backwards. Sorry. Yeah, you robbed from Justin. [SPEAKER_B]: But he was a Seer, not a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, I'm probably why I saw it. [SPEAKER_C]: Because I was a Seer fan. [SPEAKER_E]: I might be the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: A lot happened. [SPEAKER_C]: You probably were. [SPEAKER_E]: I think I might be the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: I think you are, too. I think I just. I don't know. I was so close. It was just backwards. And then you saw the seer in the middle. Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: I didn't look in the middle. There was another werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, both of you? [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_E]: Mike and I. Yeah, we said hi to each other. You did hear us. [SPEAKER_C]: True. So if there's any other villagers out there, any info. [SPEAKER_D]: I think we should kill Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: It seems like it's like, I think we killed Mitchell. Just a me kind of night. [SPEAKER_D]: I robbed from you. [SPEAKER_E]: I think we killed Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: So you know whether I'm lying or not. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Dang. [SPEAKER_D]: And you switched us. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't know if he's, like, lying about what he switched, but I know I'm just the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: So who did you switch? I didn't see the troublemaker in the center. [SPEAKER_E]: No. [SPEAKER_C]: I feel very Alone. [SPEAKER_D]: I saw the drunk here, and I saw a wet roof right there. So I was lying earlier when I said there was two. There's only one. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, there's a lot of info going on in chat. That's where some of my guesses are coming from, unfortunately. [SPEAKER_E]: I think we vote Mitch. [SPEAKER_D]: So who did you switch? [SPEAKER_C]: So what did you say? [SPEAKER_D]: I saw these. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh. [SPEAKER_E]: But what if Mitch is the Tanner? [SPEAKER_B]: What if there just isn't a filmmaker? [SPEAKER_D]: I mean, a Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: There might not be a Tanner. There might not be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, there's at least one werewolf. Or Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: I mean, there could be. [SPEAKER_E]: Werewolf, werewolf, Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: No, because this is a drunk. I saw it in the middle. [SPEAKER_B]: Might be the tenor. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, but then drunk would be out, so then it would switch. [SPEAKER_D]: No, this is the drunk. [SPEAKER_E]: If you were lying, though, and it was werewolf were of Tanner, the drunk would be out in 100%. [SPEAKER_D]: What I'm saying is, I am not lying. [SPEAKER_E]: That's fine. I don't like Mitch's story. [SPEAKER_C]: Dang. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, I mean, he's never confirmed again when we've asked him who we switched. What? [SPEAKER_C]: I've said, like, 10 times who I switched. [SPEAKER_D]: But I've asked you and you've given. [SPEAKER_C]: Me this because I don't. This is garbage. I'm by myself. I can tell. [SPEAKER_D]: Who did you say you switched? The two people. I said I switched. How about the people then? [SPEAKER_C]: I said I switched. [SPEAKER_D]: I thought we were. [SPEAKER_A]: You thought you were joking. [SPEAKER_D]: God, I switched you. [SPEAKER_C]: I switched you. [SPEAKER_D]: But you're not pulling a pole. [SPEAKER_C]: Maybe I'm pulling a Paul. [SPEAKER_D]: That's the thing, right? [SPEAKER_E]: Like we don't know. [SPEAKER_D]: And like this. This fucking Paul Meta that's shown up in the Troublemaker makes it so that we can't actually start talking until there's 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_C]: Nope. [SPEAKER_D]: See, I'm gonna just sit here for 30 seconds. [SPEAKER_E]: So we're killing Mitch. [SPEAKER_C]: Can't we just go to a vote? [SPEAKER_B]: I was the tenor. I'm gonna believe Mitchell because I'm probably not gonna win if I'm still the tenor. So whatever. So that would mean that Justin's a tenor, which would mean I'm probably a seer. So we should vote together. And we should probably just vote for Mike. Or. [SPEAKER_E]: No. [SPEAKER_B]: What did you claim to be? You haven't claimed to be anything. [SPEAKER_D]: He's been sitting with a thumb up his butt. [SPEAKER_E]: I was actually the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. Who'd you rob from? [SPEAKER_E]: I don't want to say that. [SPEAKER_D]: All right, then we kill Mike. No. [SPEAKER_B]: We vote to the left. [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_E]: Maybe I robbed from Paul and he has a Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: No, I think. I think Mike is that. I think Mike probably robbed from you. Did that happen in that order? No, no. He would still be the Tanner. So you probably. Oh, fuck. Did you rob from somebody who is actually bad? Is there actually. Okay. I'm like the only person. [SPEAKER_D]: I was a werewolf. So there's a werewolf in here? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, there's. There's. This is so effed. There's two bad guys, Tanner and a robber. And then a fucking. [SPEAKER_B]: If I'm werewolf, which I promise they started. [SPEAKER_C]: That's why there's no other info coming.

[SPEAKER_E]: I know. There's only one werewolf out there, so he looked. [SPEAKER_B]: Actually, I don't know if Mitch is lying. [SPEAKER_E]: So there's one werewolf. He saw this one, which I saw in the middle. He's a robber. Claimed it real quick. [SPEAKER_D]: That's too convenient. Yeah, I mean it quick, because that's what I am. [SPEAKER_E]: No, you can convince them, not me. [SPEAKER_D]: That's what happened. Are. [SPEAKER_C]: Wait. [SPEAKER_A]: Now you're claiming to be the robber and have robbed the troublemaker from Mike? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. Okay. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't know what's going on. You're both lying. [SPEAKER_E]: You're the robber. Now you rob the insomnia. [SPEAKER_B]: I am not saying anything. I did not rob. [SPEAKER_D]: Wasn't the robber. [SPEAKER_B]: I was the insomniac. I woke as the fucking insomniac. [SPEAKER_E]: And I hear all saying they were insomniac. [SPEAKER_A]: Listen, I wasn't the robber, but I woke up as the robber. As the insomniac. [SPEAKER_B]: No, no, no. [SPEAKER_A]: So somebody robbed insomniac for me insomniac and woke up. [SPEAKER_D]: How does that make sense if you saw robber in the middle, buddy? [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: That's fucking bullshit. [SPEAKER_B]: I think. I think this is what we have on our hands here. [SPEAKER_E]: Fucking ate this baby. [SPEAKER_B]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_B]: Why is that about what? [SPEAKER_E]: He says something really doesn't make sense. [SPEAKER_A]: Those are both villager roles. [SPEAKER_B]: What do you mean those are both villager roles? [SPEAKER_A]: Like it doesn't make sense for you to be lying about that. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm not lying about it. I was the fucking insomniac. [SPEAKER_A]: You guys woke up. [SPEAKER_C]: You guys, like, both woke up in. [SPEAKER_E]: The middle of the fucking night. [SPEAKER_A]: We just didn't. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Cause you guys both claim an insomniac. All right, we gotta figure out. [SPEAKER_E]: You and I both know whether this robber was or was not here. [SPEAKER_D]: That's what's weird, because I was the robber. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, we both. [SPEAKER_B]: He did not rob from me because I was the aesthetic. I do not believe you at all. Okay? [SPEAKER_D]: I was pulling. I was pulling a plus 4 uno I robbed from Paul. [SPEAKER_E]: Nothing makes sense. [SPEAKER_A]: No, yeah, you woke up as a robber. Oh, okay. Yes. Yes. No, that doesn't make sense. [SPEAKER_D]: So then Mitch said robber was in the middle, so we gotta fucking kill him. [SPEAKER_E]: You guys are in my head now. I think I just saw what the fuck I saw. [SPEAKER_B]: Mitch, I believe you. We have to kill one of them, too. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, One of them is a Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: What? Why? [SPEAKER_E]: I know they're not both werewolves. I know that for 100 factors, I saw a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Like, I also know there wasn't a robber in the middle, but there was. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm pretty sure there was not a robber out there. There was a. Fuck. I'm pretty. You guys are lowering my confidence. But I started off at 100 confident. [SPEAKER_A]: So you're saying you're seer and this is robber? Werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Fuck it. No, I was this. [SPEAKER_D]: You weren't that. [SPEAKER_B]: I was this. [SPEAKER_A]: I think the only reason that Mike would be lying about that is if he's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. Yeah. So that's why Mitch is the safe kill. [SPEAKER_B]: No, no, no, no. Mitch is not the safe kill. I think Justin's the safe kill. [SPEAKER_E]: No. Cause I think I know Justin's the safe kill. [SPEAKER_D]: But Paul's also claiming he's a robber. [SPEAKER_B]: Then I'll be on your team, Mitch, to vote. [SPEAKER_D]: And I'm confirming Paul's story. [SPEAKER_E]: All three of you are lying. And that doesn't even make sense. Cause I saw a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Why do you think I'm lying? [SPEAKER_D]: This gruffy little luff about you. [SPEAKER_B]: I. I am 100% on your side. I believe you. [SPEAKER_D]: He's gonna vote for you. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm not gonna vote for you. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm gonna vote for Josh. [SPEAKER_E]: There's no way he's gonna. [SPEAKER_B]: Because he's the one who's throwing me under the bus the most. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: One minute remaining. [SPEAKER_B]: But what was Paul? [SPEAKER_E]: I don't know. [SPEAKER_B]: Paul was probably the trouble. Probably. No, Paul was a Tanner. You're the werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: No, I'm pretty sure Mike is the tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, I'll kill Mike. I'll kill Mike or Mitch. Both of them are lying. Paul. And I know what's true here. [SPEAKER_A]: Mike, did you. Did you start as a tanner? [SPEAKER_B]: No, I started as the insomniac. [SPEAKER_A]: No, Mike, I need to know if you started as a tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: I did not start as the tanner. I started insomnia. [SPEAKER_C]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_E]: All right, I'm gonna be voting Justin. [SPEAKER_A]: What did Justin you're claiming you robbed from you? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Let's hear your best tanner move right now. Just whip out some weird oddball. Oh, you were seer. [SPEAKER_D]: He was a troublemaker. He switched me with somebody. Yeah, 100%.

[SPEAKER_C]: Classic, Classic. Classic. Justin's a werewolf and he's trying to put me down. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, so there still could be two. [SPEAKER_A]: There could still two werewolves could have been here. It could be just a Tanner out. [SPEAKER_D]: It could just be a Tanner out. [SPEAKER_A]: But it could also be a Tanner was here. [SPEAKER_D]: So you switched us. [SPEAKER_E]: Who'd you rob from? Mike? [SPEAKER_C]: We know he didn't swap us. We'll find out in a bit. [SPEAKER_A]: I either. I either robbed a Tanner or a werewolf. I either robbed a Tanner or a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Mmm. I believe you. Were you a seer for real? I believe it. I was a Tanner and I totally guessed the Seer. That was luck. I think he just robbed it from me. [SPEAKER_D]: I'll check out. [SPEAKER_A]: So, yeah, that checks out. [SPEAKER_C]: So don't vote Mike. [SPEAKER_D]: So we don't kill Mike. [SPEAKER_E]: We just vote. We would vote to the left, apparently. Werewolf saying that there's no werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Here's the thing. Mike actually stole from me because I was a werewolf. That's why he's happy that we're not killing him. He'd be fighting if he was. So he's the werewolf, but I'm a Tanner, so also kill me. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, because that means you're the Tanner if the switch happened. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, because I saw. As a werewolf in Insomniac Paul, you. [SPEAKER_C]: Have some big decisions to make. [SPEAKER_D]: So this is what we're currently looking at. This is. [SPEAKER_A]: So I know who I'm voting for. [SPEAKER_C]: I absolutely know who's still on my team. [SPEAKER_A]: Why do you absolutely know? [SPEAKER_C]: I mean, I know that I'm myself and I'm. [SPEAKER_A]: Where? [SPEAKER_C]: Which one am I? [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, Mitch thinks he's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: He's a robber. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, can we really quickly go over this sequence of events? [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, sure. [SPEAKER_D]: Werewolf saw insomniac. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: Robber stole from me, switched us. That's my working theory. The fact is, Mike was okay with getting killed. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, we kill Mitch because I actually switched Mike and Mitch. [SPEAKER_B]: Duh. [SPEAKER_E]: And you can count on that because I guarantee it. I always do that. No, I did it a little bit early, but still no. [SPEAKER_A]: Then we don't kill him because I actually robbed from him. So then he's back at the Tanner again. [SPEAKER_B]: One minute. [SPEAKER_D]: So who did you say you robbed from? [SPEAKER_A]: Mitch. [SPEAKER_D]: I'll kill Mitch. He deserves a Tanner win. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: I'll kill Mitch. To either kill werewolf or kill his Hannah. I don't care. [SPEAKER_C]: Dang. [SPEAKER_E]: As long as the werewolves don't. [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, here we go. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't know what's happening. [SPEAKER_D]: Let's go back in time. We're saying you robbed from me. [SPEAKER_A]: Sure. [SPEAKER_D]: Because you were okay with us not killing you. [SPEAKER_A]: I mean. Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Then you switched these two. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. No, no, no. So we're saying that. [SPEAKER_D]: So who did you rob from? [SPEAKER_A]: I did rob. This way. And then these were SW. [SPEAKER_E]: Just tell me what I did. [SPEAKER_C]: MMVs were switched. [SPEAKER_B]: No, no, no. [SPEAKER_D]: You still the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: That's so. [SPEAKER_E]: No, no, no. [SPEAKER_A]: You. You said you switched us. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: Mitch is back at the tenor. We killed Justin. [SPEAKER_D]: No, we're killing Mitchell.

Did you wake up as the tanner or the Seer? That's a good question. I think Mitch is the tanner. Well, did you switch these two? I did, yeah. Okay, we vote for Mitchell. No, we don't vote for Mitchell. Yes, we do, because I robbed from Justin. Who was the werewolf? No, no. Oh, no. I 100% was the seer. I tossed saw two werewolves in the middle. 100%. Don't let Paul sow dissent. As I said, there is someone who would do it. He thinks he's the tanner now. That's why I'm just voting left. I'm voting left. Mitch is not saying anything because he knows he's the werewolf. Because he woke up as the werewolf. There's no werewolves. That's literally impossible. I think it was this and then put, hi, Russell. Or did you rob from him and then I just switched you guys back? No, I robbed from Justin. It was werewolf. And then if you switched me And Mitchell. Mitchell's now the werewolf. There's no werewolves. There are two in the center. I think if there is a werewolf, would be Justin, but I don't think he is a werewolf. I think Justin thinks he's the Tanner now I'm just voting left. No, that is all I do. I'm saying I didn't switch them. I 100%. I switched you too. Ow. Ow. Hi. And he's not. He's not changing his story. So I believe. I'm. I'm inclined to believe Justin. Yeah, I mean, I think we have to vote left. Can we at least vote right so that I can vote for Mitchell? Nope. Come on. I'm voting for Mitchell. We can do it. So if you don't go right. Yeah. You can lose the game. That's fine. That's fine. We'll lose. We're allowed to vote center, right? No, I thought if we all agree, because the rule is you vote left. Is it? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, how's the rule? I thought it was just to. No, it says in the book, vote left. Oh. Okay. I'm ready to go to vote. I guess that kind of makes sense. So, okay with voting left. Tanner might fuck it up, but we'll see. Well, the Tanner will lose if they fuck it up. That's true. Yeah. Wait. Oh, no. The villagers win no matter what. Now, as long as we don't kill the Tanner. As long as you don't kill. No werewolf exists. As long as we don't kill a Tanner, we win. We don't kill the Tanner, we win. I got a little caught up in my own life. Who did you switch? Who did you switch? You and Mitchell. Okay. Mitchell's the Tanner? Yeah. Oh, my God. You were the Tanner from the beginning? Yeah. Oh, so he was the insomniac. This was this. You woke up? Yeah. That's why you're not saying anything. I didn't put that together. It took me a second. Sorry. We can both laugh. We're good. My bad. So we're both left. Rob. Rob, Justin. Yeah, sounds good. It sounds good to me. Time is up, everyone. If a villagers kill a person."}

Right after we came up with that strategy. I mean, it was this year. Yeah, no, I totally saw two werewolves, I promise. Sick. Just no one else was this year that wasn't Was me.

[SPEAKER_B]: I mean, there is a way. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, there's a will, but there's technically a way. Close the window. [SPEAKER_C]: Actually, you woke up as he saw me. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I did. [SPEAKER_D]: You didn't. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, you got me there. [SPEAKER_C]: But. [SPEAKER_E]: The reason you got me there is because I woke up. Well, I didn't wake up. I was the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: You started as it. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I started as a troublemaker. I thought that was fascinating. [SPEAKER_D]: How do we proceed past this conflict? [SPEAKER_B]: Well, one of you guys is the werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Or the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: No, Tanner's in the middle. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, yep. [SPEAKER_C]: Nailed it. One of them's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Or you must have saw the other werewolf. Dang. [SPEAKER_E]: Dang. [SPEAKER_C]: Or did you see the other werewolf? [SPEAKER_D]: I'm fine with you guys, like, voting for both of us, and then I vote for you. We both die. [SPEAKER_E]: That doesn't. That won't happen. [SPEAKER_B]: That actually does sound kill both of us. [SPEAKER_D]: Pretty tight if, you know, there's no Tanner. You know, one of us is a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: If each of you guys are one of us, then you guys vote for each other. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, but if. [SPEAKER_E]: If one of us is the werewolf, we would vote for one of you two. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. So we kill Paul. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. Cuz I'm fine with that plan. He ain't. So. [SPEAKER_E]: Like, we could do that. But Mitch would just vote for one of you, and then the werewolf would win. [SPEAKER_C]: No werewolf. The would still die. Oh, no. If we guess wrong. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, you have to guess right. [SPEAKER_B]: So we vote for Mitch. Paul votes for himself. As an honorable man would. Look, I'm done. I can't contribute anything else. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, no, I would just listen to. [SPEAKER_B]: What you guys say, and if you Say nothing. [SPEAKER_E]: I can't either. I switched you two. [SPEAKER_B]: Cool. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, I'm so stupid. I'm forgetting that my role is I swapped you with someone. Like, if you started as a werewolf, which you did, I'm. [SPEAKER_C]: So you say you swapped me and. [SPEAKER_D]: Just you're not a werewolf anymore. Do you believe me? That I swapped you? [SPEAKER_E]: No, because I'm the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I like voting for Mitch. [SPEAKER_B]: Now I'm gonna wait to see what they have to say. [SPEAKER_C]: That's fair. [SPEAKER_E]: Who did you switch to? [SPEAKER_C]: Great. [SPEAKER_E]: Still a little from it. Because I was a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: Who'd you swap? [SPEAKER_E]: I said them. [SPEAKER_D]: How are you guys gonna decide? [SPEAKER_B]: Whichever. I mean, if this is where you guys are gonna go, I'm just gonna wait for times to run out and then just slowly point my fingers. Didn't defend themselves better, in my opinion. [SPEAKER_D]: How are we supposed to defend ourselves? [SPEAKER_B]: We guys have the same story. [SPEAKER_E]: Honestly, I feel like we won because they don't know that we're both werewolves. Yeah, we just have to decide which one of them. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, they can't both be werewolves. As I saw Werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Unless there's three werewolves. [SPEAKER_B]: I might have slipped another one in. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, werewolf in real life. And it's a full moon tonight, so forgot about that. [SPEAKER_D]: So do we have anything we can do? I'm voting for Mike because I swapped you with this guy. Wait. [SPEAKER_E]: All that I know before Mitch is for sure lying. [SPEAKER_B]: I think I'm voting for Mitchell. [SPEAKER_A]: One minute remaining. [SPEAKER_B]: Because he tried to throw fire on somebody else. That's death to me. [SPEAKER_E]: It's death. [SPEAKER_D]: We can go to a vote.

[SPEAKER_F]: Did you confirm? [SPEAKER_B]: I didn't confirm. [SPEAKER_D]: Someone we have to kill my. Miss Mitchell. [SPEAKER_F]: Miss Mitchell. Miss Mitchell. [SPEAKER_D]: Why Miss Mitchell? Because I switched you two. So he's the hunter now? [SPEAKER_F]: Did you switch these two? [SPEAKER_D]: No, I switched with you two. [SPEAKER_B]: I switched with you, but I robbed from him. What's the order? [SPEAKER_D]: Do you rob the mess and then you're just back? [SPEAKER_B]: Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: Should we kill Mike? [SPEAKER_F]: No, I'm the hunter. You're the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: I think Justin's the Tanner. Like, is the tannery. [SPEAKER_C]: I felt like I'd had get switched. [SPEAKER_F]: What if you're not the troublemaker? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, Paul's definitely not the troublemaker. He's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I'm lying about who I troublemade. I'm the tan. [SPEAKER_B]: Shoot. [SPEAKER_F]: Shoot. Dang. Wow. [SPEAKER_C]: Just like that. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, I'm just gonna, like, take a quick break and let you guys figure this out. [SPEAKER_B]: Dang spilled. [SPEAKER_F]: Dang spilled. [SPEAKER_B]: So we got Tanner, werewolf. I can confirm one villager, and you're just. You have no info. [SPEAKER_F]: Is it that villager you just don't want? [SPEAKER_B]: No, you Mike. [SPEAKER_F]: Holy shit. [SPEAKER_B]: So what do we do, Mike? [SPEAKER_F]: I don't know. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't know either. [SPEAKER_F]: I don't know. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm gonna. [SPEAKER_F]: I think I'm gonna aim for you. [SPEAKER_B]: And then you aim for him. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. No. Do a ricochet. [SPEAKER_A]: No. [SPEAKER_F]: No ricochet. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, I'll vote for Justin, too, if you're voting for Justin. [SPEAKER_F]: Because I think I. I might have. I don't know if we're. I don't believe he's the troublemaker. So I believe we're still switched. [SPEAKER_B]: Or we vote left. [SPEAKER_C]: We don't want a vote left. I'm just gonna be open on the table. [SPEAKER_F]: I think we killed Justin. But he could be the. [SPEAKER_C]: What was your tangent? [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah, what was your tangent? [SPEAKER_B]: No, there's no tangent. Soh catoa. [SPEAKER_F]: Because if. If he was actually the Tanner, then the trouble might never happen. You robbed for me. You're the hunter now. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, like I think we have. I'm just gonna like let you have that. [SPEAKER_F]: Like, I don't wanna. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, so they jumped in the same card. So I'm just gonna like accept it. I fucked that up. [SPEAKER_C]: I thought I got switched. I saw Robert a troublemaker and now I know he's a Tanner. It's a nightmare. [SPEAKER_F]: You saw a tanner in the center? [SPEAKER_B]: No. [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_F]: What'd you see in the center? [SPEAKER_C]: Saw an apprentice here. [SPEAKER_F]: That makes sense. [SPEAKER_B]: Can we kill the hunter? [SPEAKER_F]: You're the hunter. [SPEAKER_B]: I thought you're the hunter. [SPEAKER_F]: No, you robbed from me. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay then I'll. I'll vote for Justin. Fucking shoot me for poem. [SPEAKER_F]: Sure. [SPEAKER_C]: Can we actually. [SPEAKER_B]: Have we done that yet? [SPEAKER_F]: No. No. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: Are we gonna do that? [SPEAKER_B]: What are we doing? [SPEAKER_D]: Tell me what to do. [SPEAKER_C]: I think we're killing Mitchell. [SPEAKER_F]: I think we're killing Mitchell. [SPEAKER_D]: Cuz he's the hunter. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. I'll kill the hunter. It'll be fun. [SPEAKER_C]: No, we don't kill Mitchell. [SPEAKER_F]: We're not. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm just saying this because you guys are gonna lose. He might have grabbed the Tanner from somebody. He might have grabbed from Paul. [SPEAKER_F]: No, I don't think so. [SPEAKER_C]: I think so. Otherwise he wants to get like he's saying it's a perfect cover. Just shoot me in ricochet. [SPEAKER_B]: You got me. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, he could have switched with. [SPEAKER_D]: That's genius for the hunter in this manner in the same game. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, because no hunter is requesting a ricocheted off until Mitchell was the hunter. [SPEAKER_B]: Ricochet. [SPEAKER_F]: Who do we kill? [SPEAKER_D]: Mitch. [SPEAKER_B]: Ricocheting. [SPEAKER_F]: Do we kill? [SPEAKER_A]: One minute. [SPEAKER_C]: No, Paul's not a hunter. [SPEAKER_F]: Paul's the hunter. [SPEAKER_B]: I think Mike's would robber. [SPEAKER_C]: Sorry. Paul's a robber, but Justin's still the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: So we killed Justin. [SPEAKER_B]: Let's fucking ricochet off the real hunter. [SPEAKER_F]: No, we kill Paul. [SPEAKER_D]: No, we killed Justin. What the fuck? [SPEAKER_F]: We killed Justin. [SPEAKER_D]: He's saying is a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: We kill Paul. [SPEAKER_F]: We kill Paul. [SPEAKER_B]: We've came. We do it through the hunter. [SPEAKER_C]: I cracked it. I cracked it. You're the hunter. You were the robber. You were a werewolf. I was a Tanner. You robbed from me only. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, can we kill him through the hunter? For the love of God, please, can we just kill him through the hunter? [SPEAKER_C]: It's too dangerous. [SPEAKER_D]: It's too dangerous. [SPEAKER_F]: No, it's too dangerous. [SPEAKER_B]: That's gonna take a risk. [SPEAKER_C]: It's too dangerous. All right, I will kill. [SPEAKER_F]: No. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, well, I'm Tanner, so fucking sure. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm killing. I'll kill off the hunter. [SPEAKER_B]: No, no, no. [SPEAKER_F]: Do not kill off the hunter. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm killing the hunter. [SPEAKER_D]: Cause Jesse Mike is going down, and his only option is to kill Mike. [SPEAKER_B]: You gotta decide who to kill. [SPEAKER_F]: I can't. Don't put that on me. Yeah, you gotta doing. [SPEAKER_D]: You can't do it. [SPEAKER_F]: I know two."}

[SPEAKER_D]: I didn't know that. So we know it's Mike. Oh, so there's no Tanner. That's sick. [SPEAKER_E]: I didn't say I agreed with you. [SPEAKER_D]: I deduced you.

[SPEAKER_C]: Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: So, dude, what were you. [SPEAKER_D]: It was robber. [SPEAKER_B]: What if I told you I switched you with someone? [SPEAKER_D]: I would tell you that that person is now a robber. [SPEAKER_B]: Wouldn't they be a troublemaker? [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, yep. If I did the math right, yes, they would now be a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_B]: Ooh, awfully suspicious. [SPEAKER_D]: Always. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you switch me? [SPEAKER_D]: But they won't be bad. We can do that. [SPEAKER_C]: What was your question about my card? [SPEAKER_B]: Like, you're like, gonna die on this hill. [SPEAKER_C]: No, I'm not gonna die on this hill. I was not the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: Where were you then? Because there's either a hunter or a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Yep. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, so what were you? [SPEAKER_C]: Hunter or werewolf? [SPEAKER_B]: Great. [SPEAKER_C]: I was hunter. [SPEAKER_E]: On the nose. Mitch is lying. I know. [SPEAKER_D]: I wasn't lying. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm not gonna say that yet. I need to figure out why Mitch is lying to us. [SPEAKER_D]: Ain't lying. Was a robbery. End of story. [SPEAKER_B]: Can I go on a theory? [SPEAKER_D]: Yep. Roger Rabbit. [SPEAKER_B]: Werewolf. And you saw a werewolf in the center. That's why you're so hopeless right now. [SPEAKER_E]: I didn't think you looked that hopeless. Thanks. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, I got some good news for you, Mitch. You were the person I swapped with. You were one of the two. [SPEAKER_D]: Good. They're now a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: Not anymore. Because I robbed you. You pass it on. I'm sticking to my guns. I'm sorry. I've done this before. I'm telling the truth. You gotta listen to me. I'm being framed. [SPEAKER_B]: Dang. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, no matter what, no one could confirm anybody. [SPEAKER_B]: How do you guys. [SPEAKER_D]: I can confirm one person. [SPEAKER_C]: No, remember. [SPEAKER_D]: Remember how I can confirm the villager team? [SPEAKER_C]: I mean, you can confirm him, but he can deny you. [SPEAKER_B]: Yep. [SPEAKER_E]: But no one can start really lucky claiming that. [SPEAKER_D]: Claiming what, Robert? [SPEAKER_B]: That he licking well, he did after I said it. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, there you go. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, no, I was second person. [SPEAKER_B]: Second. Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Does that say anything that you confirmed. [SPEAKER_B]: The only other person that said something on the table? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: So should we kill Mike? [SPEAKER_C]: No. I mean, I was going to kill. [SPEAKER_B]: Mike, and Mike votes for somebody as the hunter. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm voting for Mitch because he's the most suspicious. [SPEAKER_A]: One minute remaining. [SPEAKER_C]: I was the hunter. 100%. [SPEAKER_B]: So how do you guys feel if you were the one I switched to with Mitch? [SPEAKER_C]: That'd be awful. [SPEAKER_E]: Like, I need to know if you switched me because, like, chances are if you switch with one of them, that I'm a bad person now. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, I already said Mitchell's the one. I one of the person I switched with. And I switched with one of you guys. [SPEAKER_E]: Right. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, so Mitch was 100% bad. [SPEAKER_E]: I need to know if I was the person I got switched with. I need to know if I'm a Tanner or a werewolf now. [SPEAKER_D]: You weren't. You ended up good. I'm making no progress on who I am. [SPEAKER_E]: Werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Only 30 seconds left. Oh, God. [SPEAKER_E]: I don't know what to do now. I have nothing else to give. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, actually, I know that I'm voting for you because I know that you just conflicted my story. [SPEAKER_B]: I switched you guys. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, then it vote for me. Dang. [SPEAKER_B]: Did you? Yep. [SPEAKER_D]: Like I started. Good. I'm sticking to my gun. [SPEAKER_B]: I kill Mike. He's a hunter. He can make the hard choice.

You started as a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: No, no, no. I was a seer. [SPEAKER_C]: If you were the seer, the one. Did you see? Yep. [SPEAKER_A]: I looked at two in the center. [SPEAKER_C]: What were they? [SPEAKER_A]: I saw a werewolf and a good card, and I'm not Gonna reveal which one it is. [SPEAKER_C]: What'd you see? I saw a werewolf and the drunk in the middle. [SPEAKER_A]: Ooh. So you're. Which. [SPEAKER_C]: Which two did you guys look at? [SPEAKER_A]: I didn't point out which ones I looked at. [SPEAKER_C]: Which two did you look at? [SPEAKER_A]: I'm not gonna reveal that because I don't. I. Because I know I'm a seer, so I don't think he saw a drunk in the center. So I believe you're still the drunk. So I don't want to tell you which the werewolf was yet. [SPEAKER_C]: I have a very strong opinion of which one's the werewolf, But I don't want to say anything until I know who got switched. [SPEAKER_D]: If Rachel thought he was the werewolf, it wouldn't have mattered. If I switched him, he would. Thought he was the drunk. Wouldn't have mattered because he would switch after I switched him. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, I didn't think of that. [SPEAKER_A]: It's true. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm an idiot. So even if I. If you made me the werewolf, then I would. [SPEAKER_A]: I'm werewolf myself, so it was me and Chris. Yeah. Okay. I was the werewolf. What? [SPEAKER_D]: Of course. [SPEAKER_C]: So now he's the one wrong with you because I 100 was the werewolf, the lone werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Oh, I see what you did. [SPEAKER_C]: You. [SPEAKER_A]: You. [SPEAKER_C]: You. You got one step ahead of it because he was the werewolf, and now. [SPEAKER_A]: You'Re the werewolf, but you knew it was gonna happen. Now known he's now freaking out because he thinks he's the werewolf because it got switched. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, so then you were the werewolf off the start. Which card did you look at in the middle? Because there was only one werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Which card? Which card? [SPEAKER_D]: I saw the other. [SPEAKER_A]: I saw one werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: He's my lifelong friend, and I don't recognize him. That's awesome. [SPEAKER_A]: I saw werewolf in the center. Okay. I still saw werewolf, So I was. [SPEAKER_C]: The werewolf, and I saw the seer in the center. I believe he was the werewolf, which is why I wanted to call the seer off the start. This card was the seer. I believe he was the werewolf because he said he saw a drunk, and I was the drunk, and then. So now you're the werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: All right, I'll kill Mike. [SPEAKER_C]: It's a spirit. All right? [SPEAKER_D]: And if it's not Mike. Well, well done, Chris. [SPEAKER_B]: Everyone."}

There were two good cards. So, like this and that. I get it. Good cards. Yeah, good cards. [SPEAKER_A]: Good cards. [SPEAKER_B]: Good cards. Werewolves. So, Mitch, don't. Be careful what you choose. My roll's already out on the pumpkin table. I hate this game. I don't believe that for a second. All right, you don't have to believe. No way did you do it four games in a row. Three. This is game three. I'm fucking telling you. What can I ask, did you wake up? Is it correct? No one swapped me. I want you just to tell me which card you looked at. Okay, that's a problem, because now everyone knows the cards in the middle. Well, Caitlyn and Mike, too. Yeah, Together we'll know all the cards in the middle. Let's combine our powers. I have zero info. Although she could be bad because I did not look at it. I could be anything. I did. I looked at these two, and they were good. And one of them was the witch, so there's no other messing with the center. Was the other one the troublemaker? Other one was the troublemaker. Well, it seems Brad and I are in a bit of a pickle. This is not good. I believe that because I didn't get swapped once. Yeah, I think Mike's good. So it. I'm actually the PI. It means that the three other people at the table with us are bad, by the way. That's the funny thing. How do we get the Tanner on our team? 33% chance you guys fuck this up. Who do you guys want to vote for? One of us. Tanner? No, I think we should vote for me. God damn. I think you should vote for me, and here's why. All right. This Is not how we play this game. This is a nightmare. I haven't woken up yet. Mitchell, wake up. God damn it, Brad. You have to pick one of these two to vote for. Who would it be? Oh, man. Justin, you can't. You're not Brad. Yeah, but I didn't think you were. I'm the right. I like how we're arguing to which not villager we're killing. Yeah. Caitlyn, if you had to pick out of those two, who would you pick? Justin. Justin. Justin. Who would you pick out of these two? Justin. Caitlyn would vote for Justin. Justin would vote for Justin. Justin would vote for Justin. Doing the math, Mike. Oh, God damn it. We could just kill Mitchell and put him on his misery. We could. No, Tanner, I think we gotta vote. We gotta vote Justin. Okay. Justin. I'm voting Justin. Justin. Not Justin, him. Justin's the tanner. He killed it. He killed it. Well, he just fucking said his name. It's Justin. Justin. Justin. God damn it. Just inception. Justin ception. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, we all. [SPEAKER_B]: I am gonna vote for Mitchell to put him out of his misery, though. Yeah. Yeah, I want him to come. Can Mitchell at least come with me? You need to, like, FYI, werewolves. Two werewolves out there. If the. If the Tanner dies, you lose. Yeah. Oh, heck yeah. I mean, yeah. Yeah. But I'm okay with that. I'm okay with dying. And I'm gonna just bring with Mitchell myth. And so someone like, let's. If anyone wants as long as, for example, you guys, we have to vote together. Yeah. You two vote. [SPEAKER_A]: One minute remaining. No. [SPEAKER_B]: No vote. I'm voting Justin. Yeah. So we're voting Mitchell. Yeah. Are you voting? [SPEAKER_A]: Who are you voting? [SPEAKER_B]: Vote for Justin. Yeah, I'll vote for Justin with you. Cool. So, yeah, cool.

[SPEAKER_B]: Oh, that's what you're claiming to be? Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: These are nothing but a tool to. [SPEAKER_B]: Just help us deduce, to visualize.

That was actually the problem was good. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, okay. I'll just turn it up a little bit. There might just. So there's not as much echo. Cuz there's going to be an echo if you hear from both sources. [SPEAKER_D]: Mike, what were you. How much of a werewolf were you? [SPEAKER_C]: I scale from 1 to werewolf 0 because I have some information. But I would like scale from one werewolf. I'm just saying she's a wolf. [SPEAKER_B]: How werewolf were you? So do we just say like what we think we are? [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, you meant whenever you play this, we got some louder speakers, so we should be good. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. So there's a timer going down. Yeah. You can say what you are or you can bluff. You can say something. [SPEAKER_C]: I have information, but I want to know other people's information. At least a little bit of other people's information first. Because I could say that someone's wrong. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: I couldn't. [SPEAKER_B]: I didn't learn anything because I was the troublemaker. So who'd you switch? So they're the werewolf. They're no longer the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Mitch, you coming out? [SPEAKER_D]: I was a villager. [SPEAKER_C]: You were a villager? [SPEAKER_B]: Way. [SPEAKER_D]: An old do nothing villager. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, I was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: I was a robber. [SPEAKER_C]: Who'd you rob from? [SPEAKER_D]: I robbed from Caitlin. [SPEAKER_B]: Wait, if you were the werewolf and I switched you, and you know what. [SPEAKER_D]: The consequences of that are if you were a werewolf? [SPEAKER_B]: I was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Yes, she was. [SPEAKER_C]: Can confirm what happens first? [SPEAKER_D]: Which I robbed first, then it was swapped, so I became the werewolf, then she swapped us. So you're now the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: So we're both werewolves. Caitlyn's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: I didn't swap. [SPEAKER_B]: Caitlyn's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: So we gotta vote for Caitlyn. [SPEAKER_D]: Right, Mike? [SPEAKER_B]: I think I understand. It happened at once. It happened. [SPEAKER_D]: So I never actually did rob. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: So what we're saying is it really did cause trouble. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you did, yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: So I think we have to vote for Caitlin at this point because that's the only thing that makes sense to me. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, definitely. Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: It's a little late, but I think I followed the trade of logic a little bit. [SPEAKER_C]: It'll tell us. [SPEAKER_A]: Time is up, everyone."}

It's probably going to be me. I don't know. Does this. Does the wood work with this overlay? Wood we have so wood curious. We have a blocker so Chat can also not see what's going on.

Did you look at people or in the middle? I looked at the middle. Cool, cool, cool, cool. My chit isn't here. I was the drunk. Oh, villager for the drunk. We forgot to do the chit part. That's okay. I forgot to look. You were drunk. I was the drunk. You were the drunk. Okay, okay. So you don't know what you are. Truth. But she looked at the center, so it's pretty good to know. What do we get to I switch with this one, if that matters. You don't have to say what you saw. Just say no, you didn't look at that one. Well, that's horseshit. What? What? No, it isn't. I just recalled her. That is what I saw. No way. That is what I saw in the story. No way. Interesting. Nuh. Nuh. She's a. Who'd you rob Her? I robbed with you. You robbed me? Yeah. Can you confirm that she's the seer? I can confirm she was the seer. Who'd you troublemake now? They could be working together. Uh huh. They could be. Because you're very adamant about that. Mitchell's always very adamant. You guys were adamant about the last game, too. I was a drunk. You know, the ladies gotta stick together. But it's the information, it's the mischief. They could both. I don't know why. She's either wrong or she's lying. And I don't get why she would lie in this situation. Unless she's a werewolf. She's trying to throw me under the bus. Does this change any switch you with somebody? You switch me with somebody? Yeah. Yeah. That's really interesting reading. Well, I can't confirm either of those. I can confirm. Okay, wait. That's what I saw. What's order here? I'm better. You switched last. I switched last. That's what that was. But drunk goes after me, so if he was the drunk, even if that's what that was, he's still the werewolf. Cause that's definitely what was there. She's throwing me out of the bus and I can't defend myself. Cause I'm betting that's what that was. Well, I switched YouTube. Okay, so. Well, then if I was a werewolf. You're a werewolf. Yeah, I have no idea what it was because I was a drunk or not the drunk. I have no idea what I ended up being. Okay, so. Yeah, well, no, if I switch them, the drunk goes after. So even if you weren't, if you were actually the drunk beforehand, you're still the guaranteed bet for being a werewolf. I'm still what? The guaranteed bet for werewolf? If you were actually the drunk. If I was drunk. Okay. But you. And you switched us, though, right? No. 100%. Yeah. Okay, then I. I actually was a werewolf to begin with. She called me out and she was correct. You're the werewolf. So I'm the werewolf. Fucking kill. Matt. It's you. I think I. I think that's right. Yeah, she's right. I was a werewolf. I was not a drunk. I looked at this one. This one was a drunk, though, which is why I took that roll. So I don't know what you're going. I think you did. I may have. Oh, the lie in the story. We'll start wanting her in. I'm so incompetent right now. Time is up, everyone. I wonder if they put them back in the riddle."}

Easy. Any objections? Yeah, I was just joking. I knew you weren't a werewolf. Robert Joel bigger liar. Oh, cool. This is lying. Why was I lying? Yeah. Because I was a copycat and I saw something bad in the middle. Well, I see. I mean, one of these two copycat looks. One of these two, he pulls three forward. Well, two rolls. Good point. I'm the dummy. How's Kafka at work? He assumes the role that I see in the middle and gets to look before even the werewolves do their thing. So does that mean he wakes up as a werewolf? Good. Yeah, he could. He could. So I see. So you as the copycat saw bad roll. Why did you say robber? Because I'm trying to lie. Because we're like, okay, well, I looked at him and he was a Tanner. So that's how it started. Who robbed and who troublemade. Interesting. If Paul's a robber, we can't trust a word he says. Why? Because if he stole from me as a chance to try to get killed. Right. Yeah. Well, let's just be honest. Figure this out and know who to kill. Adults. We'll just. Everyone will be honest. We won't lie. Who'd you rob? I robbed from James. And I can confirm he's a seer. Convenient. Get James on your side so I don't yell at you. I I with like 95 conviction that Paul probably just rob for you. Yeah, I am also on that. But why does there need to be drama? She was the most peaceful player I've ever played with. So who did Joel make? You were one of them. Nice. Thank you so much, friend. Thank you so much, friend. I can get a victory out of this round now. Does that Mean, you were the 10 at a start. No, I was the tropicat and I saw a bad card in the middle. No, you're lying. So you troll me. Him? Yeah. Excuse me. I'm just trying to make him with. When do you. When do you try to make. After Mitch goes last. Yeah, everything. Yeah. So let me think of how to get an interview. That's why you should look in the middle. Not as another player, as the seer. Panicked. Panicked with your like 4 seconds to do something. Yeah, I believe that I didn't rob from Justin, but I think he might actually be a werewolf. You were a Tanner. I know that. What if they're werewolves? Which. If you gave them to me. I don't want to tell you. No, one of them could be. How do we. One of them could be what? A Tanner or a worm? You're a Tanner. What are you doing? I was a copycat. I saw a Tanner or a werewolf in the center. What is. Is there any information? What if I just. We need to find out who came from here. How can we figure it out? I think we just killed Paul. No. Okay, somebody here is lying and I haven't called them out yet because I know something about. You wanna say? Yeah, you should, because I have the information that I gave you which was I was a copycat and I saw Tanner or werewolf in the center. Not accurate, but. Oh, can you just tell me if I'm. Wait, maybe. Cause if you're the cop, you can't. Oh no. I see. Before they rob. Okay, so this is very interesting. I'm not the robber. No shit. The robber is in the center. How do you. Okay. Cause he's a werewolf. Because I'm the seer. No, no. And this is why I thought. Oh, somebody is fucking lost. This is why I wanted to know. Justin. Jeez, we were doing so good. Why did you. So he's the Tanner right now. Don't kill him. Okay. Who do you think we should kill? Paul? Probably fucking me. Who do you think we should kill? Not Paul. If you troublemade them. Because I was the God damn. Which one did you see her? Which one did you see? Who'd you start out? Tanner. Yeah. So did you actually. Troublemaker. Yeah, yeah. No, I was so either lying. I think. I think Justin robbed James and is a werewolf. Because I think Justin. I think he's lying. Yeah, we just vote left, so it's either. But if the werewolves don't get killed, they win. But I. There might be a werewolf. I think it might be called. But I'm voting left. Yeah, okay, we're voting left. If I'm Tanner, it doesn't matter. So vote left. Okay, we'll vote left. Time is up. Yeah.

I was the copycat and I copied the troublemaker. All right, check this out. I mean, we can run with this story. I'm okay with it because we shouldn't also just believe James. Well, I do. Yeah.

And we need to see the whole snake before we can really trust the story. Well, thanks, Mitch. Yeah. So as it stands, this is what we're looking at. Correct. So. And you copycat the troublemaker. Who'd you troublemaker? The real problem, though, is that I was actually the robber. Oh. Oh. I can confirm the story here. Mitchell was actually the Seer. Why would I lie about that? Why not? I was 100% the robber. Yeah, me too. 100%. Oh, no, that's fine. We could both be mutual robber. Yeah, sure. We'll put it right in the middle. Okay, guys, I'll do that. Okay. But James, I'm. Who did you rob? If you robbed anyone. I definitely robbed James. Oh, yeah. You robbed me as a seer. I robbed him as a seer. What the fuck? Who do you trust more? The mission. Yeah, because you guys are both werewolves. Cause I rob from mission. You're a werewolf. I didn't wake up with you, did I? Does anybody care I didn't wake up as a werewolf? I mean, I would like to know if I was switched because I stole from Mitchell as a werewolf. I did switch you with somebody. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. Does it matter to you guys if we find out who. Yeah, you were Tanner. No, I was a werewolf. You started as a werewolf? Yeah. Oh. So who'd you switch them with? One of you two? Okay, fuck you. That's the options. That's the options. I've given a lot of information. So what are you actually claiming to be? Robber Rob from seer. Why does. No. Because you're lying. Yeah. And saw two werewolves in the center. Yes. And I was a werewolf for having seen two werewolves. So, like, I'm already distressing the own seer that I definitely robbed. Yeah. Like, James, this is crazy. I saw two werewolves. Why am I being attacked by two people? For being accused for lying? Because there's a copycat who actually saw a werewolf in there. Oh, yeah. And a tanner trying to get killed. No, I saw the troublemaker. Did you know it's the card closest to him? So I believe him. I mean, most people, when it's like, look at a card from the center, I think instinctively go for the center. Most. Not true. I go for the one. I always go for the center. I actually also switch it up. Every time I switch it up, never. I feel like I have to equally give each card place a turn. One thing going for Paul is that he did call out troublemaker without even hearing what your role was. Yeah. Brave. Brave. Very brave. Very brave. Brave witch. Yeah. Brave prairie witch. This one. Brave is just what happened. Yeah, man. Yeah. Okay, so you troublemade Justin and somebody. Nice. So how do we proceed? So you still claim robber. You think I was. No, I was a werewolf. I was a werewolf. Oh, yeah. Okay. So he was Tanner. So either way, it matters. It does matter. Yeah. So how do we proceed? We could. Okay, let's know who you trouble. Me. Yeah. Let's pretend we don't find out. What do we do? Like, who would you vote for? James. Cool. Who'd you vote for? I think Justin, Paul's not gonna answer that because he knows who he's supposed to meet with. I honestly don't know, though, because, like, there's a lot of I don't know. I don't trust. I think they're. They're both werewolves. I don't know anything. I was starting to not trust the seer that I robbed from. Why? I have to vote. I have to vote for you. You have to vote for me because we don't know who it was until. That sounds cute. So then you vote. I'll vote for Paul. He'll vote for me, and then he. No, he votes for who the werewolf is. Oh. None of us need idea. Oh, so Paul, you switch me with someone. Damn, dude. Cool. Holy shit. K. What? We vote for each other. Yeah. You vote for Paul and you vote for the werewolf, and they get killed. Time is up. Okay, everyone. Three, two."}

Yeah, this has been really good because it's just coke. Classic. Okay, yeah. Copycat. Really? Yeah. Pump this one up. Speaking of, who was the copycat? We have four liars here, right? What? We have four bad people because no one said anything. All lie round. Yeah. Ooh. Easy. Why don't we just all say we're Tanners and vote where the heart votes. Vote where the heart. Vote. Yeah. Beauty. Interesting. What'd you see? Let me guess. One werewolf and a robber. No, no, no, no. A troublemaker, maybe. Am I 100% right? You might be 100% right, because you were the seer, and that's what you saw. No, no, no, no, no, no. I trust Mitchell. Or do I? Good point. I can't confirm Mitch's story. Can't. I can't either. I'm just guessing. I can tell you it's wrong. Ooh, we definitely have some. Yo, dude. What? Were you taking this? Yeah. Oh, you were the robber. No. Do you think you're the robber? You were the robber. I don't think I'm the robber anymore. You were the robber. Okay. Wow. I hate this game. What'd you say? Who are you? I saw him. He put the werewolf down first. Excellent point, but that's not what I saw. Any guess. You looked at this card cinder most. Which card did you look at? What was it? The one you put the wearable. What was it? Was it the seer? What was wrong? This is a troublemaker. You didn't look at that card. I've got a feeling. I don't think he looked at it. I got a feeling. Okay. That one. Where are you? Oh, tonight he solved it. He cracked it one night. So who'd you trouble make? No Tanner. Robber. You're good, but you're troublemake I was a seer. No. I don't know why you think I'm a robber. Because I robbed you. I looked at this card, sir. You think I'm a robbery. I think I know. I looked at this card. Which one? This one? No. Is that what you saw? These fuckers were werewolves. And I robbed from Mitch and he was a werewolf. So unless you troublemade me, I'm a werewolf and I'm so mad at them. Kill me. No, we don't kill James. We don't kill. We just don't. Anyone asking to be killed, you just don't kill in this game. Those are the rules. So on that note, please don't kill me. I'll kill James. Yeah, kill me. Let's do it. Go to vote. Did you see a Tanner in the middle? They're fucking. They were werewolves. Who'd you troublemake? Does it even matter? You're a Tanner. No. You were werewolves together. It doesn't matter. You were a werewolf. Can we listen to this man? The end of the world is coming. Everyone's a Tanner. Or a werewolf. Doesn't matter. Cause fuck you. You weren't a copycat. You liar. What are you? A Tanner? I'm a werewolf now. What do you think? You're thinking you're a werewolf. I know I'm a werewolf because I robbed from Mitchell, who was a werewolf. Wolf. Werewolf. When I robbed from you. That is absolutely not true. Oh, why would you be lying? I made you good. I made you a good guy. You're. You're an actual crazy person. You got like actually nuts. Paul, I think it all hinges on you. Why would Angel. What were you to start? I was a werewolf. I knew it. What? What were you to start? I was a seer. And what did you see in the middle? I believe he's a Tanner. What did you see in the next? I saw a werewolf robber. That's what it was. Who do you want to vote for? I don't even know. I want to vote for myself. Okay. He was. I was a werewolf. I think he did rob for me. I think he's a werewolf. Now. We all know who you switched, Paul. And I do think he's a Tanner. He didn't wake up with me. I'm not telling you who I switched. I think there's a Tanner and two werewolves out here. No. Oh. I'm voting for James. Time is up, everyone."}

Oh, you're about to show things in the middle. So who are the two werewolves? I'm gonna pause for a second. I will never believe a seer who looks at cards like this. So J is instantly out in my mind 100%. Look at two cards in the center like this. 100% like this. I am out. You said you always look at the center card and you went and looked at everything. But I know, buddy. Especially because my role's J. Drive. That's a horseshit grasp. James. I trust you to the literal end of the earth. That's a horseshit grasp that he's these two fighters. I trust you 100%, James. I think these two guys are werewolves. I think you're right. Could be a Tanner. I don't. No. You guys woke up together cause you wanna claim troublemaker. And that's a horseshit poll at something that's irrelevant to the game. Cause he has no way to debunk our information. I agree. How do we claim to be troublemaker? How do we pass this? You were trying to. Cause I was holding the token. I was thinking what you were doing with it. No, no. You were like trying to get it. Cause you were holding it. Yeah, yeah, he was trying to get it. See, they're werewolves, man. You can kill us. Let's kill him. Sure. For me. Let's go to vote. Kill him. No, don't just. We're not just gonna go vote. Why? We gotta talk this out. Oh, we just did. No, you did. Who are you? A swarwolf. Swearwolf. Swearwolf. Okay, Justin, what were you? Troublemaker. No, it's okay. James. No. I swear to God, if you don't Vote Paul with me. I'm very upset. So. Okay. I'm okay with voting Paul. How do you feel about that? He's trying to trip us. I think so too. Yeah. Vote Paul. How dare I try to play the game. Yeah, exactly. See? Look at him. Did we go to his early vote? No, we made that mistake once. Yeah, that was really bad. Oh, you guys. But the information's out there. We're prolonging a game. If you're not cool with an early vote. Do you mind giving some info? Yeah. I figured it out. No one can vote again. I agree with you. This is very interesting. I agree. I switched you two, by the way. You don't have to believe. You don't have to believe me. That's fine. Yeah, 100%. I'm with James. Yeah. Troublemaker's right there. Yeah, no doubt. Nerdy Steve. The audacity of playing this game. Is it really Michelle? Robert's name is actually Robert. Yeah. Named after us. Playing board games. Named after us. The. The Robert. Yeah. I'm okay with going to a vote. James. Nailed it. I don't want to waste more time.

I have a hint. I have a sneaking suspicion. But I need to hear from everyone else first. I want to go last. Yeah, man. Justin. Nice. Was the cr. We saw what they did and we said, let's try that out. So funny. No. So let's pretend that that's true. That's not true. How can we leverage that? How can we? Mitch, does that mean you're the troublemaker? Potentially. I mean, I know you are. Oh, you do? Yeah. Sick. I now trust you. So here's what I think happened, buddy. You as either the werewolf or the copycat. Saw a werewolf here, didn't you? Yeah. Then I. So this is what I think happened. I think that happened. I can tell you this much checks out. So then did you switch him? And if you say it was he associated with me, I'm going to. Did someone rob from me first? No, he robbed from me. No, I robbed from chest. So we're looking at this. I can tell you. How do you know that this is this? I looked at these two because I was like, let's literally do what James did, and it felt great. Oh, my gosh. Okay, the power spread. Did you switch me with him? Yeah. Did you? I did not swap James with anyone. Oh, sick. Sick. Really? Yeah. So we can just kill him and play one more tiny round. These are two baby rounds. I think so. No, no, no, no. Is there any chance that Mitchell is a werewolf? A copycat werewolf? Potentially, but I don't think James would have went on that lie. Oh, yeah, because you saw the werewolf in the middle. Yeah, I saw the werewolf and the Tanner, so I don't think Mitch is lying. Okay, okay. Wait, wait, wait. Who'd you swap? You didn't see the copycat? These two? Yeah. If Mitch. Wait, if Mitch was the copycat werewolf, he wouldn't Say that he switched us. Correct. Hold on. You switched, Remember? Do you remember which choice one. Come up with a. Come up with a strategy. Yeah, you got. I've been there. That was last round. Both of us. Like, I've been there. What do we do? Okay, I can figure this out. Yep. I was a werewolf. I was alone. You saw. He's figuring out the actual truth. I saw a werewolf and a Tanner. You saw a werewolf in a Tanner. So that checks out. This comes out to play. So Mitchell played you two. That's the interaction. The only other interaction in this game that could have happened is Paul could have robbed from you. Paul robbed from me. And then you're the werewolf. Oh. Then I'm okay with still voting for you if that's the case. Yeah, I guess Paul technically could have done that. Yeah. But in that case, I'm the werewolf and I'm okay with voting for you. So we. Did you rob from me? This is interesting. Because if I rob, you're good. And we are. He could be bad. Nice. I robbed from James. I have to vote for Justin then. You got him, man. Can we still kill James at the same time? Let's vote for Justin. And then after, we'll kill James. No. So I think what we should do is you two vote for me. You and me vote for him. Sure. I think that's totally fair. Just in case. Just in case this didn't happen. No, because villagers win if a werewolf dies. Yes. So I'm totally okay with this. So. I was kidding. I'm voting for you. Oh. There's no reason to vote for James. I gotta vote for you. It's scaring me. I know who I robbed from. So you're okay then? Were you a werewolf at any time? Legitimately? Yeah. They robbed from you. I gotta vote for you. Go for it. No, no. Because I was a werewolf and I saw a wolf. Yeah. No. That's the thing. Sorry. I should have been like this. So. No, no. So he could strat good. Like full. Yeah. I'm okay with dying. I'm just thinking we should kill James too. Such honorable death. I don't see what's. What's the downside of. Also James. Maybe he's the Tanner and we can kill him there too. But he's not. I'm the Tanner. Listen, we'll vote for somebody else then, won't he? No, I'm gonna vote for James because I think he's still a werewolf and I'm gonna kill him. If you started. I'm voting for Justin. Yeah. Will you? The werewolf. Could you? Because the copycat werewolf has to wake up as a werewolf. There is no copycat werewolf in this game. But just the rules. Yeah, yeah. Okay, so I didn't see. Okay, okay, okay. Yeah, yeah. So we kill Mitchell, right?"}

[SPEAKER_C]: Very safe. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, so we're all safe, but you're the riskiest character. [SPEAKER_D]: I am the riskiest of the characters. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, well, I switched you with someone. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, good. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, technically, the world. [SPEAKER_D]: I was. Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Wait. Okay, wait. So you were the werewolf? [SPEAKER_D]: I was, in fact, the werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: You're not telling who you switched with? [SPEAKER_C]: Not yet. [SPEAKER_E]: Not yet. [SPEAKER_D]: Not yet. [SPEAKER_B]: Sorry. Forgive me. When you're troublemake, can you switch with yourself? [SPEAKER_C]: No, no. [SPEAKER_E]: And I accidentally switched with myself, and then I realized, oh, shit. Can't do that. And I have to fix it so fast. [SPEAKER_B]: You're right. People do make mistakes in the chat. Okay, so if you are now not the werewolf, that means. [SPEAKER_D]: So one of you two is. [SPEAKER_C]: One of us is. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. Also, that's also a werewolf. Just in case anybody cares, there's only. [SPEAKER_E]: One werewolf out there. Okay, I'll just review. I switched it with you, Elana. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, so that makes me the werewolf, Right? [SPEAKER_D]: Yes. Yes. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: Murder. Death. [SPEAKER_B]: Me. [SPEAKER_C]: All right, well, either of them. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, no, no. I was not a drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: That's true. [SPEAKER_D]: Mitchell went. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, so are we. Yeah, so that makes me the werewolf. Right? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. We good with that? [SPEAKER_E]: Can we get this on board? [SPEAKER_C]: With this. I like this. [SPEAKER_E]: This seems too easy. You have. If this is the tr. At this point, you had one out. What you could have done is pretended that you actually robbed her instead of me, in which case she would have gone back. It would have gone back. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, strategy. [SPEAKER_C]: If this is correct. It might not be correct. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, yeah, you could be lying. But it's in your best interest to kill the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Wake up, go to sleep. [SPEAKER_C]: They could both be werewolves. And playing a very nice game of pinning on you now. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, yeah, right. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, we totally. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, no, because I switched with him. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, you robbed him originally. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, yeah. So then she would be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: So there really is only one werewolf. And logically, it's me. [SPEAKER_D]: And it's the worst ever. When you're a werewolf and you pick up the werewolf car. Yeah, that's now. What? Me? Somebody. [SPEAKER_C]: All right, all right."}

[SPEAKER_C]: Oh, second, no werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, it's possible. [SPEAKER_C]: Mike found the werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: It's possible. But you said the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: I can. I can. [SPEAKER_E]: There's only one. [SPEAKER_D]: I can verify Mike's story. [SPEAKER_E]: Did you rob from me? [SPEAKER_D]: I did. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, so what were you then? [SPEAKER_D]: I was the robber. So I started as a robber. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Now he's the seer. [SPEAKER_D]: Now I'm the seer. [SPEAKER_B]: You guys are claiming you just swat? [SPEAKER_D]: Yes. [SPEAKER_B]: Interesting. [SPEAKER_E]: He's confirming my story, so that's good. [SPEAKER_D]: Can anyone. Can you confirm my story? [SPEAKER_E]: I mean, not 100%, but indirectly, maybe. Indirectly. [SPEAKER_D]: All right. [SPEAKER_E]: I did not see a robber anywhere else. [SPEAKER_D]: Sure. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: So that works. [SPEAKER_C]: Cool. That's cool. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: So what do you do, werewolves? [SPEAKER_B]: I'm not a play by person, so I'm just gonna sit back for a minute and really strategize. What do you think you are? [SPEAKER_E]: No, no, no. [SPEAKER_C]: You looked at Min. [SPEAKER_D]: No, he saw drunk in the middle. [SPEAKER_C]: No, he saw drunk in the center. [SPEAKER_E]: Did you too? [SPEAKER_D]: You're a werewolf. Or she's a Tanner. No, that's a go to one for Tanner because this is already a risky character. [SPEAKER_E]: It's true. It's very true. I did see drunk in the center. Okay, 100% saw drunk in the center. [SPEAKER_B]: So you're now not claiming to be the drunk. You're claiming to be the town. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, so she's a werewolf, and that's just the one of us to vote for her. Or she's. She's double tanning me right now. Head's gonna blow up. Okay, so we have two People claiming to be Tanner, and my life is in ruins. [SPEAKER_E]: Only one of them is a werewolf. Cause I saw a werewolf in the center. [SPEAKER_D]: All right, so we got one werewolf and one tailor. So you guys are. [SPEAKER_E]: Which you guys. [SPEAKER_D]: No, but it's not only on us. You guys want to. You guys are on different teams here, so. [SPEAKER_E]: No, they're not. [SPEAKER_B]: No, we're. [SPEAKER_C]: Cause one of us wants to be killed and one of us doesn't. [SPEAKER_E]: If the Tanner gets killed, the werewolf's still win because they weren't killed. It's a joint victory. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, it's a joint victory. [SPEAKER_E]: So they're on the same team right now. We're trying to figure it out. [SPEAKER_D]: If. If we kill. If we kill the werewolf, the Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: Loses, the Tanner loses, and we win. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: So you want to kill the werewolf and not the Tanner? [SPEAKER_B]: Yep. [SPEAKER_E]: If we kill the Tanner, then everyone loses except for the Tanner. Oh, no, no. Werewolves still win, I believe. Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: If you killed a Tanner, then the werewolf stayed alive and the Tanner died. Or the werewolf stayed alive and the Tanner died. [SPEAKER_E]: Double check. The Tanner hates his job so much that he wants to die. [SPEAKER_C]: Like it's nothing. [SPEAKER_B]: See, you get me in my third game, and I'm all of a sudden strategized. [SPEAKER_C]: The Tanner adds a lot of complexity. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, I like it, actually. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. I think Caitlin is the werewolf. Alanna's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: What do we think? [SPEAKER_D]: And I think it. Because Caitlin came out and took a role. [SPEAKER_E]: Yes. [SPEAKER_D]: And I think she took that role because she saw it in the middle. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I think so too. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: So I. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, I don't know. She was playing. When she put it down, she, like, pushed it towards the center and was looking at me because she knew I looked at it in the center. So she was seeing if I put. [SPEAKER_A]: One minute remains. [SPEAKER_B]: Thank you. [SPEAKER_E]: If she put it here. And I said. And I'm in my head, I'm like, no, that wasn't where that is. Then maybe she's trying to make me vote for her. So maybe she's the tenor. [SPEAKER_C]: This is great. [SPEAKER_B]: I know. Are you gonna sit back and watch. [SPEAKER_C]: Them debate about it? [SPEAKER_D]: Holy crap. [SPEAKER_E]: All right. [SPEAKER_C]: This could not have gone better. [SPEAKER_B]: I like that. [SPEAKER_E]: I know. [SPEAKER_B]: It's joint victory. It's amazing. Or joint lock, one way or another. [SPEAKER_D]: I don't know. What do you think, Mike? I still think. I think she's the werewolf, she's the Tanner, but I don't really know. [SPEAKER_B]: So we're voting to kill the werewolf still, right? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Good. Okay. Just making sure. [SPEAKER_E]: All right, let's go. Do it. Let's go that way. [SPEAKER_D]: Wait, who are you voting for? No, I'm voting for her. [SPEAKER_E]: No, you're back on her now. [SPEAKER_D]: I think she's a werewolf. And I think she's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh.

Are you serious? At Gen Con? [SPEAKER_C]: Get out of here, you lackey. [SPEAKER_D]: I want, I want, I want. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, it's Original Werewolf legacy. Huh? [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, Original werewolf. Not. [SPEAKER_D]: No, no, no. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, like the long ultimate werewolf legacy. [SPEAKER_A]: Oh. [SPEAKER_D]: Because he said one night. Ultimate One night Werewolf Love letter. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, we play Love Letter a lot. It's so good. [SPEAKER_A]: I love the design of minigames because if you don't have the time or at a coffee shop, you can just sit and have them in your back pocket. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: This is my favorite. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: And this even plays well with three. [SPEAKER_A]: So straight up and honest, I'm gonna be no help. I was out drinking last night. [SPEAKER_D]: I mean, you still could be a lot of help. You could be the target. [SPEAKER_A]: I could be. [SPEAKER_D]: Thanks. [SPEAKER_E]: Absolutely. That's always what I want. She could also be the Tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: Yes. Robber. Okay. Who'd you steal? [SPEAKER_D]: I don't want to know because I can confirm a story. [SPEAKER_C]: I can confirm one of the stories. [SPEAKER_E]: You looked at somebody's card. [SPEAKER_A]: Yes. [SPEAKER_D]: Do you look at someone's card or did you look. [SPEAKER_C]: I looked at someone's card. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay. Cool. Troublemaker. Okay. No one's claiming to be anything good are helpful, so. And no one looked in the middle, so we don't know what I took. [SPEAKER_D]: Who'd you switch? [SPEAKER_E]: I don't want to reveal that information yet. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. Sounds good. [SPEAKER_A]: We're at a stalemate. [SPEAKER_C]: I think. [SPEAKER_A]: I think the Seer's gotta tell us something so we can get this unraveled. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. Literally. That's the only piece of information we have right now. Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: You can start with I'm the werewolf, and we'll go from there. [SPEAKER_C]: I saw Mike's, and I can confirm that he was the robber. [SPEAKER_A]: That he was the robber? [SPEAKER_C]: Yes. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: And you're not telling us who you robbed with. Interesting. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Mike, who did you rob? I just gave my info. [SPEAKER_D]: I know. [SPEAKER_C]: It's your turn. It's your turn. Who'd you rob from I think. [SPEAKER_E]: I think. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't know. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, I switched you two. But the troublemaker goes before the drunk. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. So it doesn't matter. [SPEAKER_C]: What so. But he robbed and then you troublemate him with Alanna. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, so that makes. Okay, so. No, no, I was. I was. I'm the drunk. But I'll have the drunk card. You still did the action. [SPEAKER_A]: Oh, right. Okay, wait. Okay. Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, so you 100% switched us. You looked at my card. [SPEAKER_C]: Ye. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, you didn't look at my card because I'm not the robber. [SPEAKER_C]: He robbed for me, so. [SPEAKER_D]: No, no, I'm the Tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: What? [SPEAKER_D]: So now this switched Tanner's gone. You're the werewolf. Because you just lied about what I actually had. [SPEAKER_A]: I did not follow any of. I was distracted by the very loud noises happening behind us. [SPEAKER_C]: I was the Tanner of this whole time. I know. No, I was. And I. I don't know who. [SPEAKER_D]: No, no, you were. [SPEAKER_C]: I was trying to feel. [SPEAKER_D]: He's the werewolf. I couldn't. [SPEAKER_C]: I didn't know what to say. 100% I was the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: And he's struggling now. The werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: And he's trying to put it on you. [SPEAKER_D]: Or he doesn't want to get votes anymore. [SPEAKER_C]: But you're not. You're good. [SPEAKER_A]: I have no idea. Are you following me? [SPEAKER_D]: She could still be a werewolf. 100% could still be a werewolf. I was 100% the tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: Troublemaker didn't choose. [SPEAKER_C]: No, you weren't. I was the Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, but it wouldn't have done any different. So I would have done that. [SPEAKER_D]: And then you would have switched with. [SPEAKER_C]: Something with his center. [SPEAKER_D]: So you could still potentially be the werewolf. But I 100 think mentioned the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm 100% positive he was the werewolf. Begin with no. [SPEAKER_D]: No. Cuz he lied and I could try to confirm it and he's just like. Yeah, I looked at your card. Yeah, I looked at your card. [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, you did. No, I. I asked you twice. I asked you twice about it. [SPEAKER_C]: You know, you are the werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Got to point out the amazing comment. Hi, here's your shovel. Please continue digging. [SPEAKER_C]: Shut up. Chat. Did they have wood? This last. That's enough of you. [SPEAKER_D]: They didn't. They did not have wood. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: He was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: You're a werewolf. That's very scary. [SPEAKER_D]: I was 100% the tanner. You said I. You switched. I'm coming out as what I was. If you had said I switched, I would have come out as werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: I was the Tanner to begin with. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, no. [SPEAKER_C]: And I had no information to work with last night because I didn't wake up. I think we have to vote for. We have to vote for Atlanta. [SPEAKER_E]: I think we vote for Atlanta. [SPEAKER_D]: No, Hunter, was that. We have to vote for Mitch. [SPEAKER_C]: I think we vote for a laugh. [SPEAKER_D]: They're voting for you. We're voting for you. [SPEAKER_C]: No, you can't vote for me because. No, you have to vote for one of those two, and then. But we're gonna vote for you. [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_A]: Caitlin, what happens if we tie? [SPEAKER_D]: We both die. [SPEAKER_C]: But that's not. No, you have to evolve either way. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, but if a. If a werewolf loses."}

[SPEAKER_C]: Bean. A Butter Babe. I don't know if you're already gone. I did not see that before. [SPEAKER_B]: She was saying she needs to go check something. [SPEAKER_C]: But also, I need to sleep soon, so no promises. [SPEAKER_B]: Peanut Butter babes leaves at 8:30. [SPEAKER_C]: She's an older lady than I am, I guess. [SPEAKER_B]: Either that or she pulled it all nighter as well she may. Okay, so we're wasting time here. All right. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. So who's. What? [SPEAKER_B]: What are we? Excuse me. So, what's your sound? [SPEAKER_C]: All right, so straight off the bat, he's lying. He's the Tanner and he wants us to think he's a werewolf. But he's a Tanner. No, I was the insomniac. I was the insomniac. You were not the insomniac. Absolutely. I was the insomniac and I woke up as the insomniac. So if there's a troublemaker here. I know you didn't switch me because I woke up as the insomniac. If there's a robber. I know you didn't take me. I'm the insomniac. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, I'm not saying what I am, but I know there's a werewolf on the table. [SPEAKER_C]: So you're the seer. Seer. Or the robber. Or the other Werewolf. Or the robber. But that means that she's the werewolf now. True. That might be why she's not saying who she is. Fair. [SPEAKER_B]: Valid. To counteract that. No, I'm the seer. I want the least. If there's a troublemaker on the table, I might not be any more. If he claims not have been moved. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. Or Kayla, what were you. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, so there is some serious horseplay going on. [SPEAKER_C]: Absolutely. [SPEAKER_B]: Serious horseplay. Because the werewolf was you. So. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, so she was a lone werewolf. She looked in the middle, she saw a troublemaker. So she's like, yeah, I'm gonna take troublemaker. Meanwhile, Tanner over there is like, I'm gonna pick a random wolf. It. I'm the insomniac. 100%. I was the insomniac. No. Then what'd you wake up as? I actually woke up as the seer. Get out of town. Okay. Oh, so double werewolf, then? Double werewolf. You guys are working together? 100%. I saw Werewolf. I woke up as the seer. So I got switched in the night. [SPEAKER_B]: So either there's a robber or troublemaker out or there's some serious lying going on. [SPEAKER_C]: No, it has to be troublemaker. Robber couldn't switch arms. But you know that there wasn't a troublemaker, right? [SPEAKER_B]: She did not have a troublemaker when I was. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, fantastic. So if there wasn't a troublemaker, then not only is she lying, but he's also lying. I don't know who's the troublemaker, but I was inside my neck. I woke up as a serum. I can confirm that story. Oh, these guys are confirming each other's story left and right. We've got two werewolves on our head. I think it's me. It might be a Tanner, but I. [SPEAKER_B]: Think there's two werewolves. [SPEAKER_C]: He's really upset when he's the werewolf. Absolutely upset when he was really upset when he's the werewolf, and it's not going his way. [SPEAKER_B]: Is this Brandon? [SPEAKER_C]: It's not going his way. I'm the insomniac, and I just woke up as insomniac. No, he's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, well, I'm definitely not the insomniac. [SPEAKER_C]: No, I am. Okay. I believe that you're the seer. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, I was the seer. [SPEAKER_C]: Yes. I think. I think. [SPEAKER_B]: I think we both makers out. Then we have a troublemaker. But. [SPEAKER_C]: But you saw werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: I saw werewolf there. [SPEAKER_C]: And even if there was a trouble, another troublemaker. No. Maybe. No. Or maybe. Or maybe. Did you just. No, no, no, no. I picked it up, and then I dropped it. I didn't mean to. Maybe. Maybe I'll take this role now. Well, maybe they're both werewolves. Yeah, it could be. Well, you and I both know that's not true. Yeah, I'm not. But. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, sure. Let's. Let's throw that out in the air just to cover your bases. [SPEAKER_C]: All right, These two. I need you both to say something bad about the other person so I know you're not teaming with two little werewolves. Name one reason why she might not be a troublemaker. Go. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, we just have to kill one werewolf. That's all. [SPEAKER_C]: Because you might be the troublemaker. No, the best reason is because she is the seer and you are ignoring that fact, so you're on her team. No, I'm not ignoring that fact. I'm stressed drinking right now. [SPEAKER_B]: I wasn't smart. I didn't bring a drink with me. [SPEAKER_C]: There's all kinds of water. [SPEAKER_B]: I have Carlo Palmer over there. [SPEAKER_C]: We absolutely have to vote for Caitlin. I'm so confident she's a werewolf and then you're defending the crap out of me. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, regardless. Hold on. So she was a werewolf before and now she's claimed to be the troublemaker. Either way, she's still a werewolf because she couldn't have moved her own car. Yeah, one werewolf. We'll just kill her. [SPEAKER_C]: Yes, problem solved. Unless you want to change to a robber there, Mike, and then maybe you. [SPEAKER_B]: How many paroles do you pretend to be? [SPEAKER_C]: I've only claimed one here. I've only claimed one here, and it's insomniac. A stress drink here now. Thanks for the quote, Elacky. There's not enough exclamation points as well."}

What? [SPEAKER_E]: Who did you switch? [SPEAKER_C]: I switch Mitch for somebody. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm not. I do not want to say who. [SPEAKER_B]: You'Re playing. [SPEAKER_C]: Guess. [SPEAKER_D]: I robbed Mitch. [SPEAKER_E]: You robbed Mitch? [SPEAKER_B]: You robbed Mitch. So now you are what Mitch was. [SPEAKER_E]: All right, this makes no sense that now. [SPEAKER_B]: Now that you look. What did you switch? [SPEAKER_C]: I don't want to say yet. [SPEAKER_E]: This makes sense. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't understand why the Revealer doesn't want to tell us where it is. [SPEAKER_C]: Louis. She did. She said the Tanner was here, but she went last. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, that's what makes no sense. [SPEAKER_D]: Which means that after I switch with Mitt, you switch this back. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I was. I can confirm this story here. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you switch the magnet? [SPEAKER_E]: No, I was. I really was the seer, though. [SPEAKER_D]: I really was. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I really was. I looked at two in the middle. [SPEAKER_D]: I can confirm he was the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: You robbed the Tanner from him? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, absolutely. [SPEAKER_E]: You know, I'm sticking. I was absolutely the seer and I saw two in the middle. [SPEAKER_C]: Two people are saying I saw a. [SPEAKER_E]: Tanner and a werewolf and. [SPEAKER_B]: You sure that was my fault? It was elac. He was leaving. I read that really fast. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, yes. [SPEAKER_D]: Tonight. Hi, Laggy. [SPEAKER_C]: If we didn't miss you, you laggy babe. Ash. Hello. You came over from Extra Life Stream.

[SPEAKER_C]: But he's gonna fuck it up because he's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: And because. I mean he. He won't win either way. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: I wasn't the. I really wasn't the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: I was the one. [SPEAKER_D]: You really were the Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: Really were the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: Thanks, Justin. [SPEAKER_E]: Why are you awake?

[SPEAKER_E]: This is all I know. [SPEAKER_C]: Caitlin's the only one who has other information. [SPEAKER_B]: I guess I think I'm alone. [SPEAKER_E]: You're definitely not. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't know if I believe Justin. [SPEAKER_D]: No, but I don't help you much because I robbed from Mike. So you just put them back. [SPEAKER_B]: Cool. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: So you're robber and you're whatever you started out. [SPEAKER_D]: So don't kill Mike. He was the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: No, it was the werewolf. She doesn't believe that you switched. [SPEAKER_D]: We could kill Justin. [SPEAKER_A]: Nope. [SPEAKER_B]: Why would we kill Justin? [SPEAKER_D]: Because he could be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: No, I don't think he could. [SPEAKER_B]: He did do that thing where he takes a roll and then like. But he was really sure about Mike not being the apprentice team. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, he was really sure. [SPEAKER_D]: But he also. [SPEAKER_E]: And all my rules this round were forced unto me. [SPEAKER_C]: No one. He didn't say anything beforehand. [SPEAKER_D]: That's why I think he might be the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: No, I was the werewolf. You don't think that the switch Mike is Haiti happened. You robbed from me. She's the werewolf. We kill Caitlyn. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't wanna. [SPEAKER_D]: Sure. [SPEAKER_B]: What do you think happened, Justin? Tell me a story. [SPEAKER_E]: I don't know. Like, I have very little to go on. That's why I'm not talking here. You switch these two. [SPEAKER_B]: Yep. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, I'm Haiti. [SPEAKER_B]: Yep. We that joke already. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, my God. We have to kill one of them. But I don't know which one. Because if Caitlyn robbed from me, I don't care. But she would be. She wouldn't be acting coy about this if there was a switch. Which makes you think she does rob from. She did rob from Mike. And now we have a. There's a tanner. I don't think Mike was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: I was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I saw the Tanner on Mike. [SPEAKER_C]: Nope. [SPEAKER_D]: Since Mike has it back. If Megan did switch us. [SPEAKER_C]: Nope. [SPEAKER_B]: Did like. Can you confirm that? [SPEAKER_D]: Yes. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, then we go left. I trust. I trust that. Sure. I accept it. Either they're double werewolves and they're playing us. [SPEAKER_E]: Kaylyn's playing too coy. [SPEAKER_C]: We vote for Caitlyn. [SPEAKER_B]: I feel alone. Guys. [SPEAKER_C]: We vote for Caitlyn. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, if that worked for me, then she's still to my left. [SPEAKER_C]: If I was the Tanner, why would I be seeing vote for Caitlyn? [SPEAKER_E]: I don't know. That's an excellent point, Mike. [SPEAKER_B]: 15 seconds. 15 seconds. I don't trust Justin, but I think I'm alone. I think I'm honestly alone. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't think you're alone. I think Justin's telling the truth. [SPEAKER_B]: I thought he just has no info because he saw this copycat. Possible, definitely possible, voting for Kaylan."}

[SPEAKER_B]: Of the suit over here. [SPEAKER_C]: What do you mean? What's happening? [SPEAKER_B]: I don't know. Your hands were, like, in front of the light, and they were, like, causing shadows on my eyes. [SPEAKER_D]: I thought you were going to say the same for other places. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm dancing with my hands in my. In the air. [SPEAKER_D]: In my. [SPEAKER_C]: Like, you just don't care. [SPEAKER_A]: Werewolves. Except for the dream. [SPEAKER_C]: I just don't care. [SPEAKER_A]: Wake up. [SPEAKER_D]: Just don't put your thumbs up unless you're the dream wolf. And then do it. [SPEAKER_C]: I will certainly do it. If I am the dream wolf, I will stick out my thumb. [SPEAKER_A]: If there is only one werewolf, you may look at a card from the center. Dreamwolf, put your thumb away. Werewolves, close your eyes. Apprentice Seer, wake up. You may look at one of the center cards. Apprentice Seer, close your eyes. Robber, wake up. You may exchange your card with another player's card and then view your new card. Robber, close your eyes. Troublemaker, wake up. You may exchange cards between two other players. Troublemaker, close your eyes. Everyone wake up. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. All right. Cool, cool, cool. So before she even says, I'm gonna be completely open and say what? What I am. Because I'm confident that I was not in the middle and not what she saw. And if she says I am, she saw what I am, she is lying, and we need to kill her immediately. [SPEAKER_C]: Sounds good. I like this play. [SPEAKER_E]: Convenient. Yeah, but not. Kaylin, I'm gonna start by asking, did you see any of our roles in the center that were. That we've said? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Was it mine? No. Okay. Thank goodness. I'm gonna assume it was Megan's. [SPEAKER_D]: Mike's. [SPEAKER_C]: Megan's. [SPEAKER_D]: Mike's. [SPEAKER_E]: And I'm sit on this for a bit, because I do know which one of these two is lying. And you know which one of these two is lying. [SPEAKER_C]: I do. [SPEAKER_E]: So we have a lot of power here. [SPEAKER_B]: Excellent. [SPEAKER_D]: They've got the power. [SPEAKER_C]: Sounds good. Have the power then. [SPEAKER_D]: So, like, what else happened? [SPEAKER_E]: How about you guys both talk through your actions? Because then we'll know once again. [SPEAKER_C]: Because if you know, if you know which one is telling the truth and which one's lying, that means you know, one of us did this action, one of us didn't. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, but still, I'd want to hear the stories you guys each make to see even further. Right, but here's the thing. You both know which of the other two is lying, right? So you know what? We all know. But we should still talk through everything, because this is how we can so. [SPEAKER_C]: We all have the same information, we're just not saying it out loud. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, but we can. That's why we have to take it a step further to see who's better at playing with their fake potential information and the fact that you don't want to talk. [SPEAKER_C]: I'll talk. [SPEAKER_B]: Alright, but let's start with Megan because she went first. [SPEAKER_D]: Wait, wait. Mike just said he would talk and now you're like. Let's start with baby. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, we're just going in turn order. [SPEAKER_D]: Great, great, great, great. [SPEAKER_E]: All right, what did you see in the middle? [SPEAKER_D]: I saw Mike's roll in the middle. [SPEAKER_E]: Spicy. [SPEAKER_D]: Right here. [SPEAKER_E]: All right, so then let's. What did you do during the troublemaker phase then? [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, that's too much information to share at all. Sure. [SPEAKER_E]: All right, Mike, what did you do? [SPEAKER_C]: I switched Megan and Katelyn. [SPEAKER_E]: All right, that's rough. That's rough news for somebody at this table. [SPEAKER_D]: So what else happened, guys? [SPEAKER_E]: So now you know what? I'm not gonna talk. I'm gonna let someone else deduce what the best course of action is because I know, but I don't want to say it. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, what did you do? Yeah, you're doing a lot of talking things. He's not shared his implications. [SPEAKER_E]: I think the implication of the fact that I told you, you and I both know who was lying. And then also the fact that I reacted to one of the actions and not the other implies heavily what I did during. [SPEAKER_B]: That's true. That's true. That's true. So you robbed from Megan. [SPEAKER_E]: I did not rob from Megan. [SPEAKER_C]: No, I think you robbed from me. [SPEAKER_E]: I robbed from Mike. Mike is telling the truth. And you should know that too, because you saw a copycat in the center. [SPEAKER_B]: I did. [SPEAKER_C]: Dang. Dang. But whatever Megan was, you are now. [SPEAKER_B]: Cool. [SPEAKER_D]: For realsies. [SPEAKER_C]: For realsies. [SPEAKER_D]: For realsies. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: She's what I was. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, I mean, I don't know. I can't. I can confirm that Mike was a troublemaker. I can't confirm his action. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, we don't kill Caitlin. She's dear. [SPEAKER_E]: So no one dies tonight. [SPEAKER_B]: We should probably kill Megan. [SPEAKER_E]: Cause I was not an apprentice. [SPEAKER_C]: Fuck. [SPEAKER_A]: You. [SPEAKER_E]: Might explain why you didn't believe. How you asked. Like you didn't believe me. [SPEAKER_C]: That's funny. Were you a regular werewolf and you. [SPEAKER_E]: Saw Apprentice here in the middle? [SPEAKER_B]: I saw the copycat. [SPEAKER_E]: Copycat in the middle. [SPEAKER_B]: I took a guess. [SPEAKER_E]: Yep. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: I love you. [SPEAKER_D]: What would you guys say if I told you that she's now ratting out her fellow werewolf? [SPEAKER_B]: No, because you didn't stick your thumb up. [SPEAKER_C]: Doesn't matter. We kill one of you, which we for sure just killed you anyway. [SPEAKER_B]: And you couldn't have been the copycat because I saw the copycat in the center. [SPEAKER_D]: I definitely wasn't. The copycat. [SPEAKER_B]: Did not stick your thumb up. [SPEAKER_D]: Caitlyn. Why? [SPEAKER_C]: Hi. [SPEAKER_D]: I love you. Why are you doing this to me? Why? Why? [SPEAKER_B]: It's a loss for me either way. I'm fucking Tanner now. [SPEAKER_C]: It's true. [SPEAKER_D]: Fine. Kill me. Go for it. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. Okay. She gave the approval."}

What is one role you did not see in the center? [SPEAKER_C]: I did not see a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't believe that for a second. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, okay. [SPEAKER_B]: I rest my case. Vote now. [SPEAKER_C]: Why don't you believe me? Prove that you don't believe me. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't need to prove anything. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, you do. [SPEAKER_B]: No. We have a kangaroo court here. We can just hang whatever we want here. Um, Paul, we have a slight problem. [SPEAKER_D]: We don't. [SPEAKER_B]: I was gonna say there's a slight problem with this. Oh. Spicy bar. Are you a robber? [SPEAKER_D]: I know. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, hey. Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool. [SPEAKER_D]: I was trying to give you that eye contact. [SPEAKER_B]: I know. I saw that. [SPEAKER_D]: I wanted us to have just a moment before. Excuse me. [SPEAKER_C]: Paul, what's happening? [SPEAKER_D]: Sorry, I was pushing again. I was fucking with you. [SPEAKER_B]: All right, so Mitch is saying he's the robber. You're saying he stole from me? Nope. Paul. Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: You stole from me. That's really funny, because I stole from Justin. That's how I know he's the troublemaker. Because I started as a robber. But, like. Cool. We can grow with that. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay. What an interesting turn of events. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, le 1010 or la circer. That doesn't make any sense. [SPEAKER_B]: All right, well, each their own, Paul. But like, why would he. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, own your each, then I'll each my own. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, all right, Mitch, per that I'm gonna say I may or may not have interacted with your card. [SPEAKER_D]: Whoa. That changes everything. [SPEAKER_B]: Does anyone care if I troublemade or. [SPEAKER_C]: Are we okay with I care if. [SPEAKER_D]: You troublemade with Midge? Cause I think I'm gonna need to probably die. [SPEAKER_B]: All right, Mike, we have a small problem here. Because I asked what did you not see in the center? [SPEAKER_C]: And. [SPEAKER_B]: And you said you saw no werewolves, but as the seer, you would have seen a werewolf, so. Ipso, that's so I didn't want to. [SPEAKER_C]: Give away that I saw the seer. So as the copycat, I did not see werewolves as the seer, I saw werewolves. [SPEAKER_B]: That's a lot of Huey. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, so really we have kind of nothing really to go on, huh? Like you guys are both saying the same thing. So there's a conflict there, which is interesting. [SPEAKER_D]: I put the troublemaker on your thing, like, so I think you could probably trust me. [SPEAKER_B]: I mean, I trust both of you, but as far as I can throw you. And then Mike is saying there's no werewolf. With this not logic you have, are you concerned about what's happening here? [SPEAKER_C]: No, I think one of them was the Tanner and just playing it up, trying to get the votes on them. [SPEAKER_D]: Like you think I'm trying to get votes on me right now? [SPEAKER_C]: No, I think Mitch is. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, thank you. [SPEAKER_B]: I. I mean, I'm the robber and I robbed you. [SPEAKER_D]: What was I? [SPEAKER_B]: I've weirdly got the robber, so I'm just as confused as you are. That is a bit of a strange thing. But I believe that that could happen one out of every a million games of one night. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, we've played about that many. [SPEAKER_D]: That's a fucking good lie. I got the fucking robber as the robber. Yeah, because it's only one role you gotta lie about now. Fucking smart. [SPEAKER_B]: Alright, well, Mike, I did switch you with one of them. [SPEAKER_C]: Cool. [SPEAKER_B]: No, but are you not concerned that maybe you are now one of the roles in his line? [SPEAKER_C]: I'd be concerned if I was the Tanner nail. [SPEAKER_B]: All right, so let's play. If you're the Tanner, do you want to die? [SPEAKER_C]: Well, yes. [SPEAKER_B]: Do you want to die? [SPEAKER_C]: I do want to die then, but I. I don't know. [SPEAKER_A]: So who are we voting for? [SPEAKER_B]: We're running out of time. [SPEAKER_D]: Quickly, Justin, here's what's up. If you switch me with Mitch, then I hope you vote for me because I think Mitch is the Tanner. If you switch me with Mike, then I hope you don't vote for me, because I think there's a chance Mike could be bad or he could be good. Either way, I don't want to die. So do we vote for whoever and then I will just be at the mercy of you. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Or I vote for Justin. Cause fuck this. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm voting for. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I don't think it matters who the switch was. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm voting for Paul. [SPEAKER_D]: If it matters, I'm voting for not Mitch. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm gonna vote for Paul. [SPEAKER_C]: I'll vote for Paul. [SPEAKER_B]: Well. Cause you're the one that I switched Mike with, okay? And Mike's the person I actually trust the least right now. Fair. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm like, honestly with you on that. [SPEAKER_B]: I'll vote for Justin. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: Time is up, everyone."}

Like, I know that can't happen with this many people, but, like, what if it did? [SPEAKER_E]: It could if the copycat saw the robber, then took a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: We're all thinking so hard about this. I could hear all three of our brains just. [SPEAKER_B]: I couldn't hear my brain. Mine was just blank. [SPEAKER_D]: It was like, yell at the island. Yeah, it was a deer in headlights moment. [SPEAKER_B]: All right. [SPEAKER_E]: We killed a minute. Great job. If you're a werewolf. All right. I was a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_B]: Justin started that. He's a woo. [SPEAKER_E]: I was a troublemaker. And I believe Mike believes me. [SPEAKER_A]: I do. I robbed from you. [SPEAKER_D]: Nice. It wasn't pretty. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, well, you know what? Fuck it. You just watched me, Mom. [SPEAKER_D]: I hope, I hope, I hope. [SPEAKER_B]: Those are really good, like, tones. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. Yeah. Like I said, it's not pretty. [SPEAKER_E]: It's not great. [SPEAKER_D]: It wasn't a nice situation for me. [SPEAKER_A]: Did you actually look at the tight of the stave? [SPEAKER_D]: Maybe. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, you can be rest assured that you are not what you started as. [SPEAKER_A]: Which one did you. [SPEAKER_B]: Which one did you look at? Because I looked at one in the. [SPEAKER_D]: Center, but I'm not what I started as. [SPEAKER_E]: No. [SPEAKER_B]: Which one did you look at? I want to know. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I'm gonna say. I gotta say silent off. [SPEAKER_B]: Which one? [SPEAKER_D]: I'm gonna stay silent. Are you a werewolf now? Maybe. Maybe on your team. Keep it. [SPEAKER_E]: Wait. [SPEAKER_B]: Who are you? A werewolf now? [SPEAKER_A]: No, I robbed from. No, no. [SPEAKER_B]: But if Justin switches with Mitchell. [SPEAKER_A]: No, I robbed from Dustin. Unless he switched me with somebody. [SPEAKER_B]: Did you switch me, Mitchell? Am I a Tanner? [SPEAKER_D]: Did you reveal yours or did he reveal yours? [SPEAKER_E]: I revealed mine. [SPEAKER_A]: He did. It's true. But he took. [SPEAKER_D]: So you might not have robbed from him, but he might have robbed from Paul. [SPEAKER_A]: Here's my story. No, no, wait. Here's my story. When. When Paul took troublemaker, I gave Justin a look. And then when Justin put his a look. [SPEAKER_D]: Ah, it proves it. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, I know shit about you. [SPEAKER_E]: I mean, you don't need to, because I know about me. And the fact that you don't believe me means you're a threat. Okay, I'm not ready to vote yet. [SPEAKER_A]: Oh, well, that. You know what? [SPEAKER_B]: That checks out. [SPEAKER_A]: But no, I. [SPEAKER_B]: 100%. I wrote for Justin. [SPEAKER_A]: Yep. [SPEAKER_D]: We both believe you, Mike. [SPEAKER_A]: Justin does. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, if you're not gonna say who you switched with, I think my best bet is to vote for you. Because then I'm probably. If I'm still a werewolf. You are. What? [SPEAKER_A]: Just switch into a werewolf like Mitch is a Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: There's a lot going on. [SPEAKER_D]: What's your. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm switching teams. [SPEAKER_E]: Did you start as a werewolf? [SPEAKER_D]: Correct. [SPEAKER_E]: Nice. Did you wake up alone? [SPEAKER_D]: Incorrect. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, spicy boy. [SPEAKER_B]: But I'm so fucking confused. Like, I. I don't know what your play is here. You. Unless you start as the Tanner, or I guess if you copycatted a Tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: Who'D you sweet bitch with? [SPEAKER_B]: I think I'm gonna vote for Justin. Because I think I'm probably Tanner or werewolf or Robert at this point. [SPEAKER_E]: So we just need to. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: He stole from one of us. [SPEAKER_D]: He stole from one of us. And I'm paused. I stole from Jessica, and then he mixed up someone. So that means out of the three of us, two of us are werewolves. We don't know which ones we are. [SPEAKER_A]: I mean, unless Justin switched me, I vote. [SPEAKER_D]: I think we vote for Justin. All three of us. [SPEAKER_E]: That means one of you guys will. [SPEAKER_D]: Lose the game, correct? [SPEAKER_A]: Yes. [SPEAKER_D]: And there's a 66% chance you will win. Huh? [SPEAKER_A]: No, I think. [SPEAKER_C]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_E]: I actually didn't switch you. [SPEAKER_A]: So we should be Paul. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: So Mitch is still Tanner. Unless Mike robbed from him. [SPEAKER_A]: No, no, I robbed from you. You're back to werewolf again. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, he's werewolf if he's telling the truth. Or we all vote Justin. [SPEAKER_A]: No, I'm voting for Paul. [SPEAKER_E]: I'll kill Paul. [SPEAKER_B]: I guess I vote for Justin. [SPEAKER_D]: If I'm still werewolf, he's fucking with you, Mike. No voting for Justin.

Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: So I saw one of your roles. [SPEAKER_B]: This is so weird. This is so weird. Y'all are playing me good on this one. [SPEAKER_C]: What do you mean? I've told nothing but the truth. [SPEAKER_B]: I think. I think you haven't told. You just defaulted. Mitch, confirm it. Confirmed. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, that's because, I mean, Mitch knows I'm on the level. Mitch knows that because he says he's seen one of these roles. And I know for A fact it was not mined. [SPEAKER_D]: I can confirm. [SPEAKER_B]: Do we have four werewolves? Like, what's going on?

I know for a fact that you are lying. And I know for a fact that you. [SPEAKER_D]: So I saw a seer in the middle. [SPEAKER_B]: No, I'm the seer. And I looked at your role. That's how I know that you're lying. And that's how I know that you're lying. Oh, great. It was a robber because you took it. [SPEAKER_D]: How do we proceed? [SPEAKER_C]: So what did you see in the middle? [SPEAKER_B]: I didn't look in the middle. I looked at Mitch's roll. I wanted to look at a roll. So I was like. [SPEAKER_C]: And what was he? [SPEAKER_B]: He was a werewolf. Again, incorrect. [SPEAKER_D]: Luckily, I ain't what I started as I can say with confidence. [SPEAKER_B]: Really? [SPEAKER_D]: So I'm on the good team. [SPEAKER_C]: Can I be real? [SPEAKER_D]: So who are you voting for? [SPEAKER_B]: Why do you think you. Why do you think I. You're not. [SPEAKER_D]: Because we got a Robert and a. [SPEAKER_B]: Trope maker out there. [SPEAKER_C]: I think Mike definitely stole from Mitchell. [SPEAKER_B]: That makes sense why he would be lying. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I think so too. [SPEAKER_B]: Unless he started. [SPEAKER_D]: He was confirming my role. [SPEAKER_B]: Unless he started as a werewolf as well. Which is why I wanted to confirm your role, because I wanted you. I wanted to see what you did when I confirmed that you were the copycat. Knowing you weren't the copycat. Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I think you just kind of. [SPEAKER_B]: Missed that and it got sucked in your locker room. [SPEAKER_D]: I was trying to not make a point of it. I was trying. [SPEAKER_B]: Justin. [SPEAKER_C]: No, no, no, no. Yeah. What was so here. So I think Mike robbed from you and I switched you two. So Mike's Rob has nothing to do with this. So, like, Mike is still a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: If we think he did that, which I think is very plausible. Do you think there's more than werewolf? [SPEAKER_C]: I don't think so. [SPEAKER_B]: Do you think there's more than one werewolf? [SPEAKER_D]: No, there isn't. I was lone werewolf and I saw copycat here. [SPEAKER_B]: Justin was the one. [SPEAKER_C]: Was that where the copycat was? Do you remember? [SPEAKER_B]: I didn't look in the center. [SPEAKER_C]: That's right. [SPEAKER_B]: Actually, lone werewolf would have looked. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, lone werewolf looks in the center. [SPEAKER_B]: I saw copycat. [SPEAKER_D]: That's why I was confident when you said me to go first but then I was not confident to say the. [SPEAKER_B]: Next part so you think you think Mike's a werewolf and I'm a robber and Mitch is a seer and you're just fucking troublemaker yeah I think so yeah so we vote for Mike I'm on board what if he switched so. [SPEAKER_C]: This is what it all was what. [SPEAKER_B]: If him and Mike are werewolves so. [SPEAKER_A]: Here'S the thing but if we seconds. [SPEAKER_C]: Left I actually what if Mitch and Justin no I actually yeah I actually am telling the truth now I actually switched Mitchell and Mike so we kill Mitchell he robbed because you're no longer. [SPEAKER_B]: A werewolf you're a robber no I was the Tanner from the beginning he's the Tanner now but then you killed me I don't fucking know you waited. [SPEAKER_C]: You did yeah we'll kill Mike I'll. [SPEAKER_B]: Kill Mike I don't sure what I kind of want to vote for Mitch because I saw time is up three."}

You may look at the player's card or two of the center cards look at another player's card. Get away from our habit, Seer. Go. Rise. Robert, wake up. It's more fun with another player's card. More information. Your new car lot more information. I want personal information. It's not about quantity. I want your sin number. You may exchange cards between. What did you see? Mitchell's in number. This is a sin card in the closure, everyone. Oh, wake up. We're waking up. Copycat. Did you miss the troublemaker? It's a may. It is a Mae. I missed it. All right, I'll let you pick. What's this going on over here? Yeah, Mitch and I are playing the game. And you guys are joking. Werewolves. So werewolves want to speak? Yeah. Speak up or forever beware. Oh, my gosh. Do you know what's really funny about these five tokens is if you look at them in this specific arrangement. Can you just like if you imagine. Okay, okay. Come on. I didn't clue in at first. Come on. That got me. Mr. First was like. Oh, what you said. It was such like different tone to what you just said. All right. We're still killing time. We're still killing time. Come on. Jesus Christ. All right. Just killing time. All right. Justin's neck. All right, Paul, which troublemaker? I was one of the roles that's been called, which is very suspicious. So is that some sort of spell? That was interesting. Suspicioso. Sick. I don't believe that for a second. I don't believe that either. I was a seer, though. Did you copycat into troublemaker? No. Is it just cuz he's being weird? Yeah. Who'd you rob from? I don't say yet. Is it bad? Are they bad? Was it bad? No, it was not bad. Oh, okay. I don't know if it was bad. It was this unknown. Oh, so I'm a little weird? Weird. Yeah. If we're. If we're at this right now. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So who did you swans? I swanched. I did switch Justin with somebody. The problem is that doesn't concern me. Because I think Mike's the Tanner. Just because it's so weird to lie about being the troublemaker. It's such a vital role to the villagers. No, no, it's not lie about your troublemaker actions. It's lie to weird. It's weird to lie about being like the troublemaker. Just say, go to Justin. Yeah, I know, but, like, it's weird because you don't actively try to solve the puzzle. You just like the chaos of your action. So, like. And that's also Mike. He normally likes to try to solve the puzzle if he's on the villager team. And I solved the problem. I think Mike. Right now, Mike's being like. He's gonna be like, actually, I didn't know anything. I was. That was funny. I like Junior's voice. I was trying to see if someone else would claim a seer. Cause I wanted to know if there was a seer up there. That's a weird thing to do. Cause why would you know. Why would you care if there was a seer if you were a villager? I feel like I would totally do that. Like, I like doing that too. Like, I feel like I was probably only shitting on my strategies when Mike does them and not when I do them. All right, so we're running out of time. Who'd you see in the middle, Paul? I didn't look in the middle. Which user? I looked at Mitchell and he was the rubber, so I can confirm he was the robber. Sick. I wanted to see if he looked a copycat again. So we don't know what. Who'd you. Mike? Who'd you switch? Actually, it doesn't matter because I did switch Justin and Paul, so. Well, your rob doesn't change anything. Okay, what were you. No. Cause he robbed first. He robbed first? Yeah, he robbed first. I don't know where you are. And then I switched these two. I'm. Leave that to me. That's my little secret. That's scary. That's my little secret. I know what you are. My wife is. Oh, boy. Bolt left. No. You're saying you switched me and Justin? Yes. You're. So you think he's werewolf. You looked at something bad? Probably. I'm not gonna tell you because you're gonna use to figure out what you are. If this is. If this is the. What is actually happening right here, then yes, Mitch, is something bad now. You switched these two. Sorry. No. You switched me. Yeah, but he robbed first. He robbed from Justin. Okay, First. So the bad card went there and then I switched the robber. So you have the robber, he is the seer, and he is the copycat, which is one of these bad rolls. Do you promise you switched me? Mike, I promise you that wasn't the same Mike. What were you? I don't know. Mike, 30 seconds left. I think we gotta vote for Mitch or Justin. And Mitch is the. What? What are you, 20 seconds. What were you? I don't know who the fuck to vote for. What were you? I'm gonna be voting for you. Yeah. I'm voting for Mitchell. Otherwise, Mitchell and I were werewolves together, so that means Justin and Mitchell are werewolves. And I'm like, maybe a Tanner copycat. Or Mike's a Tanner and Justin, something, he's telling the truth. I stole from. Time is up, everyone."}

I believe all y'all. I was a werewolf. I hope you switched me. This was the werewolf I looked at. Let's do this. Speed round. Let's vote. Lightning round. Come on, Justin, tell me who to vote for. [SPEAKER_A]: I didn't switch anybody. [SPEAKER_C]: Fuck. You didn't switch nobody. Nobody? Nobody. [SPEAKER_A]: I picked up your card, put it back down, turned to the camera, and said no. [SPEAKER_C]: If this is true, this is the first time he's ever done this. Get me. Get at me. Ready to vote? Vote for me. [SPEAKER_A]: What if I'm the Tanner and I think you deserve it? [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, man. Really? That'd be nice. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, I mean, like, totally. [SPEAKER_C]: Like, I copy this strategy and apply it next time. You are the tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: I mean, I probably will never have a round where I don't switch again. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, this is weird. I think Justin switched. Yeah, this is making me nervous. Both of us are on the hook here. Strategy. Is that what you're doing? Are you going to tell us at the 11th hour? [SPEAKER_A]: I literally never. [SPEAKER_C]: Because if you are, like, I want you to enjoy that. [SPEAKER_A]: No, I picked up your card, put it back down, and then went like this. [SPEAKER_C]: Interesting strategy. [SPEAKER_A]: Like, this is 100% the truth. If you saw what you saw. [SPEAKER_C]: I did. I'm, like, fully inclined to believe Justin and I deserve this death and loss. No. I went out on a limb to try to tell the truth, thinking that I got troublemate and I was not. You were gonna be the one. [SPEAKER_A]: I was gonna switch you and Mike, but I didn't. [SPEAKER_C]: So I'm gonna vote for Mike in case you did. [SPEAKER_A]: I like that. Yeah, I respect that. [SPEAKER_C]: Since he was the intended recipient I don't believe that you didn't switch. I didn't switch Mike. How could you not have switched? I know. This is Justin we're talking about. Justin gets pissed if someone doesn't switch. The problem is, if I'm arguing this, I know that means I'm the one. Or I am. If it's one of us. [SPEAKER_A]: I did not interact with you at all. [SPEAKER_C]: Sick. I'm killing you. [SPEAKER_A]: If I did make the switch, it would have been between them, but I did not. I was. I picked it up. [SPEAKER_C]: I like where this is. [SPEAKER_A]: I picked it up and I said, you know what? I'll switch over the mics, but I'm not going to. [SPEAKER_C]: Right. Because you confirmed Troublemark, so I weirdly trust him. And then you confirmed my role weirdly because you. Well, you. [SPEAKER_A]: What was the other one you saw in the middle? [SPEAKER_C]: It was the copycat. I was just gonna see if anyone came up with it. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, that's what we have. Or potentially this, like, let's. [SPEAKER_C]: But you make a good point. Like, we. We should vote for Mike. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't think we should vote for Mike. [SPEAKER_C]: Why not? [SPEAKER_A]: Because I did not switch you. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm ready to go. Oh, but he's not saying he didn't switch anymore. [SPEAKER_A]: Well, I mean, I told Mitchell didn't switch him, and I didn't switch him, which means I did not switch him. [SPEAKER_C]: You switched me. [SPEAKER_A]: I think Mike actually might be a Tanner, and that's why he's upset that we're not gonna kill him now. That's my guess. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm very confused that you didn't switch. [SPEAKER_A]: I didn't. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm making a point. I'm voting for Mitchell just in case. [SPEAKER_A]: That's fine. I'm still voting for you because if you're the Tana, you know, of course. [SPEAKER_C]: Vote for me. [SPEAKER_A]: Vote for me. Because I. I picked your card up. [SPEAKER_C]: Like, vote for Mitchell. Vote for Mitchell. You told me to vote for Mitchell. Spirit, I'm ready to go. Why would I vote for Mitchell? [SPEAKER_A]: No, you don't vote for Paul. [SPEAKER_C]: Justin. I'm voting for Paul. Doesn't matter. [SPEAKER_A]: What? [SPEAKER_C]: Cause I can't vote for him. No, listen, you have a really good point. That Justin would definitely switch. Yes. So I'm sor. Still voting for you. Even if he switched me? No, he switched me with somebody. Yes, I understand. So I'm not the werewolf anymore. Yeah, but he switched me and Mitchell. You're a good guy. I don't think he did. You're a good guy. I don't think he did somehow Even though I saw Troublemaker because you fucked up this whole round. I like it. [SPEAKER_A]: I have not lied. This game. [SPEAKER_C]: This is insane. Mike, I think we gotta vote for Mitch. Because I think if. If you believe I'm voting for you, I'm voting for you. I'm on Justin's side. I am voting for you. If you believe that Justin had to have switched because he is incapable of. Yes. And if he did switch, he switched us too. [SPEAKER_A]: And he still wants to vote for you. [SPEAKER_C]: And I would still want to vote for you. No, I think he switched me and Mitchell. [SPEAKER_A]: I didn't. I did not touch Mitchell's card. I picked up your card. [SPEAKER_C]: Justin Wood Lies. I wouldn't know who. Only. [SPEAKER_A]: That doesn't make sense. [SPEAKER_C]: It is left. No. Who? The werewolf. Sorry? Who? The werewolf. Yeah, well, that doesn't make sense. The werewolf wouldn't know that they are the werewolf. Yeah, but then Justin wouldn't have anybody on his team. But Justin wouldn't have anybody on his team voting with him. Justin would have nobody in his team. No, because he'd have all the villagers voting for me. [SPEAKER_A]: Which is good because you're a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: That's what he wants. Unless he's about to reveal it last second. [SPEAKER_A]: I'm not. [SPEAKER_C]: Let's just let it die down. Yeah? [SPEAKER_A]: Let's just sit in quiet for the last five minutes and seconds and just enjoy it. Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Kill the last of the time. I'm voting for Mitchell.

[SPEAKER_E]: Yo, I was the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: Wow. [SPEAKER_C]: Can't confirm, slick. I can't confirm. But I believe you. To the ends of the earth. I love you. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I'd kiss you right now. Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: You're not the troublemaker anymore, my friend. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, oh, checks out. [SPEAKER_B]: Who is the weech. [SPEAKER_D]: Which one? [SPEAKER_E]: Which? Which? This. [SPEAKER_B]: Meech. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm gonna assume I've been switched. [SPEAKER_B]: I didn't switch you, Justin. [SPEAKER_C]: Fuck. James, I have a good chance. I have a 66% chance of being switched by James. [SPEAKER_E]: Why? [SPEAKER_C]: Because you have to switch two of us. [SPEAKER_E]: Uh huh. So what makes you think I choose you? Why is that percentage? [SPEAKER_C]: Well, because it's just math. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, it's just math. [SPEAKER_B]: Just the math that makes me think. [SPEAKER_E]: What makes you think I'd pick you? [SPEAKER_C]: What about the math? Just the math. [SPEAKER_B]: The math makes me think. [SPEAKER_E]: Um. [SPEAKER_B]: What can you tell us? [SPEAKER_D]: Someone you didn't switch. [SPEAKER_B]: You probably almost could have got him. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, let's vote. Left. [SPEAKER_D]: You serious? [SPEAKER_E]: We're all villagers. [SPEAKER_B]: I haven't said who I witched yet. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh God. You make someone a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: What's the order? If he does it, then. Troublemaker. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh. [SPEAKER_E]: Tell us. [SPEAKER_B]: I didn't make somebody a werewolf. I made somebody. The apprentice Seer. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, vote left. [SPEAKER_C]: I would rather y'all vote for me. [SPEAKER_E]: Why? Oh, let's vote left. Um, it doesn't fucking matter who switched who and who route for. What if he's. [SPEAKER_D]: What if he's reverse fucking psychology ing. [SPEAKER_E]: Us right now and he's a werewolf? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, just straight up. That's what he's doing. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, he's got a 50% chance of being either. [SPEAKER_C]: That's math. That's math. Well, actually, technically, right now I have a 66% chance of being a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. Don't know math. [SPEAKER_C]: No, it's 50. 50. But I am a Tanner. I'm okay with only left if that's the case. If we're all good, honest people. I feel like Paul might have turned himself into a werewolf, though. [SPEAKER_B]: I didn't. I switched Mitchell into the Apprentice here. [SPEAKER_C]: Cool. [SPEAKER_E]: You robbed from me. Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: I really was about to look. [SPEAKER_E]: At my card to confirm his story. [SPEAKER_D]: Paul, who you voting for? I'm curious. [SPEAKER_E]: Fuck me. [SPEAKER_C]: Why are we playing? [SPEAKER_B]: Probably left. Probably James, I guess. [SPEAKER_E]: Great. I hate you. I'll vote Paul. [SPEAKER_D]: You're vote James. [SPEAKER_C]: Let's just note that Mitchell said vote James as opposed to vote left. [SPEAKER_B]: Technically, like, I'm cool with, like, winning or, like, we lose, but we kill James. [SPEAKER_E]: All right, I do feel like something. [SPEAKER_D]: Fish is going on here. [SPEAKER_B]: Did you. Who did you switch? [SPEAKER_C]: I think Paul turned himself into a werewolf. That's what I think happened. 100%. [SPEAKER_D]: I think he also did turn himself. [SPEAKER_C]: Into a werewolf, but I vote you vote for me. James, who did you switch? Does it matter? No, I don't care. Unless you switched me, in which case you should not kill that other person. [SPEAKER_D]: James, I trust you to the end of the earth. Yeah, I think he switched himself into a werewolf. Okay, if that's the case. Did you put that word? [SPEAKER_E]: How would he switch himself into a. [SPEAKER_B]: Werewolf as the witch? [SPEAKER_E]: You switched yourself into a werewolf? [SPEAKER_B]: That's what they're saying. [SPEAKER_C]: I did it themselves as well. [SPEAKER_E]: Why would you make yourself a werewolf? [SPEAKER_C]: Because you could potentially win. Because you could do you believed him when he said he turned someone into the Apprentice here? [SPEAKER_E]: Yep. [SPEAKER_B]: Let's not focus on, like, the why or the hypothetical, like, what did you. [SPEAKER_D]: Do if he did? [SPEAKER_C]: That would give me werewolf to someone I don't know. [SPEAKER_B]: James, can you tell us, like, one person switch you? Really? [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. Swap Justin and Paul. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, so we don't vote for Paul. [SPEAKER_E]: We vote left? [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_E]: Why? [SPEAKER_C]: Because now I'm aware. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm aware. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm okay with voting. I think. [SPEAKER_B]: So now what do you mean, you think so? [SPEAKER_C]: Because I think you wished yourself into. [SPEAKER_B]: A werewolf, so we killed Justin. Cause you if you think I wished myself into a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Whoa, fuck. [SPEAKER_B]: You switched us. So if you think I wish myself into a werewolf, then we kill you. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, sure, you can lose. That's fine. [SPEAKER_E]: What? [SPEAKER_B]: Hello? Oh, I'm voting. I'm so confused. [SPEAKER_A]: Time is up, everyone. [SPEAKER_B]: Justin's a werewolf."}

[SPEAKER_D]: Sick. Oh, sick. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you witch that werewolf into Mitchell? Is that why he's claiming it? No, you kept it for yourself. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I witched Justin into a werewolf because I wanted to kill him. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, fuck. [SPEAKER_C]: Wow. [SPEAKER_D]: So that was my big play, was kill Justin. [SPEAKER_C]: So I think it's pretty. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, did you see a werewolf or any. [SPEAKER_C]: What did you see in the center? [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, I'm not telling you my information. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, please. Oh, how are we gonna kill one of them? [SPEAKER_C]: Who'd you rob from? [SPEAKER_D]: I didn't rob anybody. [SPEAKER_A]: What? [SPEAKER_D]: Justin. [SPEAKER_B]: I was a robber. I robbed him. [SPEAKER_D]: I was the witch he robbed from me, but I witched him into a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Which card was it? [SPEAKER_A]: This one. [SPEAKER_B]: And Paul said he looked at this one. [SPEAKER_D]: Huh. [SPEAKER_B]: We have a small problem. [SPEAKER_C]: Dare I say, very tenacious of you. [SPEAKER_E]: Vote for me. [SPEAKER_D]: Vote for me. [SPEAKER_B]: You caught me. That is something we need to be aware of, though. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, do you think it was like, back it up, back it up, back it up. [SPEAKER_E]: Triple level playing, you guys. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, yeah, but I think this is actually what happened. Everything checks out here. We can't confirm Paul's story, which could be lying, but it's a weird thing to lie about. No. Troublemaker. Which is also strange How? Well, because Paul's normally a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: Which one did you I saw grab Justin? [SPEAKER_D]: Justin's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Because I wanted to grab this one. Yeah, okay, but Mitchell said Paul said he saw a werewolf here, right? [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, that's incorrect. I 100%. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't get why this is not a normal thing to do. [SPEAKER_C]: Correct. [SPEAKER_E]: I am a werewolf. 100% sure on this. 100% sure. I will bet real life money. [SPEAKER_B]: How much? [SPEAKER_E]: Let's see what I've got in my wallet. [SPEAKER_D]: Just fucking hundreds. [SPEAKER_C]: Were you actually the witch? Were you actually the witch? [SPEAKER_D]: No, I was that. [SPEAKER_C]: How is James lying? [SPEAKER_B]: No, I can confirm James was the witch. I can confirm he was the witch. That's what I saw. [SPEAKER_D]: Hey, did you rob from me? It doesn't matter. You're a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: I robbed from you. [SPEAKER_D]: It doesn't matter. You're a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: But yeah, you can. [SPEAKER_D]: So you were either a lone werewolf or. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, so you. [SPEAKER_B]: No, I wasn't a lone werewolf. You made me into a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: You wish. [SPEAKER_B]: So there was a. If there's a werewolf out there, then I have a werewolf buddy. But I don't think they did because Paul said he saw a werewolf right there. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, these two are the werewolves. If you can confirm his story. [SPEAKER_B]: I can. [SPEAKER_D]: Then you have a small problem. He can't. So he's fucking lying. I don't know where the witch is. I was a troublemaker and I troublemaked you too. So he ra. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, okay. [SPEAKER_E]: So you were a Tanner, and now he's a Tanner. One minute you'd think you were a werewolf, you weren't. [SPEAKER_C]: What are you doing? [SPEAKER_E]: Neither of you guys are what you think you are. [SPEAKER_D]: No, but you're a werewolf from the get go. [SPEAKER_E]: I never said get go. [SPEAKER_B]: No, I am Twitter. [SPEAKER_E]: I am a werewolf, but not from the get go. [SPEAKER_C]: Why? What are we ordering when Mitchell's a werewolf? [SPEAKER_B]: Can we vote now? [SPEAKER_D]: Can we vote now and just kill Mitchell? [SPEAKER_B]: I'm not voting for Mitchell. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm voting for James. [SPEAKER_D]: Don't vote for me. [SPEAKER_B]: I'll kill James. [SPEAKER_D]: Don't kill me. [SPEAKER_A]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_B]: Do you wanna kill James? [SPEAKER_E]: Kill James with me. [SPEAKER_D]: No, they're werewolves together. No, you're a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Cause I troublemade you, you're not gonna fucking tell us. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm voting James. [SPEAKER_B]: Don't vote James. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I'll vote James.

Oh, really? I now have twice as much information as a seer. I looked at two cards in the middle. Both of those cards were good cards. Both of those cards are now on the table. So two of you are lying. I know it's two. One of you is good. But the other. But it might be a Tanner or something. I could be lying. I. I also agree that. What do you agree? I believe your story. I'm suspicious. That he's a Tanner is my suspicion. Oh, no. He'd want. He'd want to die. No, you're right. No, no. He' I think his information's good. I'm suspicious of that. All right, so you two are suspicious. You're confident in me. Well, you didn't wake up as the insomniac. Cause I switched you. It all checks out. So, Mike. I said I didn't wake up. I know. Cause I switched you. Sweet. I woke up to the insomniac. Yeah, that. Just like, 110%. These are the two I saw in the middle. I just fell into a trap, didn't I? I think I did. So these two are our werewolves? Yeah. I, and. Me and Mike just have to agree on which one to vote for and then. But one of them could be the Tanner. It's possible. You're here again. It's true. No, no, I don't think. I don't think. I don't think they are. I think they're both werewolves. Yeah, I think our bet is pretty safe to go with either of them. Yeah. But the thing is, they're going to kill one of us. Who do you want to kill? Let's kill Mitchell. Okay. So it's going to end. Who do you want? Caleb. I'm good with that. Let's kill Caleb. Okay.

Yeah, there's no drunk. Oh, well, then we're fine. I can confirm that there were two people switching cards. Okay. There were two people switching cards. You the robber? Yeah. Did you rob for me? Yes. Okay, so are we implying then that I didn't switch? I was the troublemaker? Oh, well, then we kill Alana. Cause that's what I saw in the center. She's in a pickle. Shoot. What if I switch two people, though? Oh, yeah. He was an actual troublemaker. One of us could be in danger, and only Mike knows. I have to get a lie ready. I had to get a lie already. What? It totally wasn't even if. Okay, well, they said their information really fast, and I just had a chance to say I'm the troublemaker and he can wrote my story. I actually. I did not rob from Mike. My brain went, oh, it was a joke. They switched and then they switched back. That's wrong. Yeah, but that's where my brain went, so yay me. Okay, I did switch. You. You switched us. Well, then we kill me. You're 100% the werewolf. 100% was the werewolf. And you were 100% the seer. Yeah. And I looked at this card, and this card was a werewolf. Also a werewolf. Yeah, I didn't switch anybod. I didn't switch anymore. It's a May ability. Oh, yes. I love it when he does that. Oh, that's frustrating. You got just totally dumped on this. You have the option and Mike uses it all. I feel like I do not know this rule. It's only. Only for that character. It's only for this character. It said. He says may in the thing. He says, was it Robber may as well. No. Robber says switch your card with another player's card. Pick up your new or look at your new card. Troublemaker says you switched to other players cards. It's the worst when you are the werewolf and you see the werewolf, you have nothing to hide behind. This game literally couldn't have gone worse for you this round. Yeah. And some of them do. Every card was seen and nothing was changed. I guess. Yeah. I can't play with those odds. You guys are very customizable in 13. It's true. The robber may choose to rob a card from another player. Robber is also a may drunk. Has to. Yeah, he doesn't know what he's doing. And he's drunk. Yeah, he's drunk. He has to switch to somebody. I think the best player count for this game is three. Yeah. Oh, 100. Yeah. It gets really strategic. Oh, yeah. We didn't even. We didn't even think about it. And we're like, three. It's gonna be awful. Yeah. I thought it was gonna be. And then we played it at three and it was like the best games of this. It's like a chess puzzle playing with three people. It's so cool. Well, and I guess there's a lot of unknowns in the center when you play three. Right. There's still the three unknowns. Right. So you still have. Well, I'm happy that even though you had the option to play three, you invited me to come. Yeah. Do you want energy lotion? It's got caffeine in it. I've had it in my chocolate. I've had it in my beverage and I've had it in my lotion. You know, they came around and gave her. Gave out like free samples. That's awesome. This afternoon. All right, we're voting. Yeah."}

[SPEAKER_C]: How do you know that? [SPEAKER_A]: Because I was the insomniac, but you. [SPEAKER_D]: Ended up with the card that I started with, which is the robber. [SPEAKER_A]: So that makes. Where's our robber? [SPEAKER_C]: I think they're in cahoots together. [SPEAKER_A]: So now I'm the robber, and you're the insomniac. And you claim that. So you don't want to be killing off a Tanner, but he might be the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: What's your take on that? [SPEAKER_A]: He's on the Seer. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I can confirm one of those. [SPEAKER_A]: Well, Cyr comes before everybody else. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: So she. [SPEAKER_E]: I looked at Mitchell's robber. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. Robber, switched me as. [SPEAKER_D]: So you can confirm me. I can confirm her. [SPEAKER_A]: So why would he lie if he wasn't the werewolf? [SPEAKER_D]: He could be a Tanner. Could be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: I mean, if I'm the Tanner, then. [SPEAKER_D]: There'S all good. [SPEAKER_A]: Well, why would you lie if you weren't the werewolf? I don't know if I'm following that. [SPEAKER_E]: If he's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm trying to figure out why Mitch is lying. [SPEAKER_D]: Get out of here, Mike. [SPEAKER_E]: If he's the Tanner, it's worth lying to try to make himself. [SPEAKER_D]: Mike, come up with a good explanation. [SPEAKER_C]: Of what's happening over there. I'm thinking over here. [SPEAKER_A]: Sweat speeding down his forehead. [SPEAKER_D]: Just dripping with sweat. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: All right. [SPEAKER_C]: Nice, Chad. [SPEAKER_D]: Holy smokes. Three million. [SPEAKER_C]: Three million. [SPEAKER_E]: Wow. [SPEAKER_A]: Nice. [SPEAKER_E]: So are we assuming that Mike is the Tanner, then? Because he's claiming to Be a werewolf. I mean, either. Either he's the tanner and we kill him thinking he's the werewolf and he wins. Or we can vote left. [SPEAKER_A]: Trying to play our strategy, but play both sides of it. Well, there's nowhere else for him to go. I understand that strategic move. [SPEAKER_D]: If he was a werewolf, he would have. He would have been able to look at something in the middle. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, but he could have looked at another werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, he could have. Which would leave him who. What was the order of people revealing their cart? He went first, didn't he? [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: He was the very first person to claim to be an insomniac. That was weird. Would a tanner do that? [SPEAKER_C]: Yes. [SPEAKER_D]: Would a werewolf do that? No. Usually werewolves kind of chill out for a bit. [SPEAKER_A]: That's true. [SPEAKER_D]: And then wait to see what's available. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. Especially with the seersaw. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Said. [SPEAKER_E]: Do we vote, Mike, or do you vote to the left? [SPEAKER_C]: Problem in your logic. [SPEAKER_A]: What do you mean to the left? [SPEAKER_E]: We all vote to the left. [SPEAKER_A]: It's a draw and nobody does. [SPEAKER_C]: But I can fuck that up. [SPEAKER_A]: That's true. [SPEAKER_D]: But if he. If you're. If. Yeah, he could. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I could vote for himself. So he. If he's a werewolf, he can it up. If he's the tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: I can still it up if I'm a tan, but it's just not gonna do anything. [SPEAKER_E]: But it, like, it just. It just. [SPEAKER_C]: I just lose and I just make. [SPEAKER_D]: Someone else and we all. We all. [SPEAKER_C]: So if I'm. If I'm the Tanner, everyone votes for the left and I just vote for a random person. Villager still wins. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, okay. Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: So there's. [SPEAKER_C]: If I'm the werewolf and we all vote to the left, I would move. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: Yes. [SPEAKER_D]: So what did we think he was. He was. We think he was a Tanner because he spoke so quickly and. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, that makes good sense. [SPEAKER_E]: I think he's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: From a completely third party objective. That makes logical sense strategically without knowing his character at all. Yeah, but I think it's a 5050 draw. And so far those have not been kindly to Mitch. [SPEAKER_D]: So let's not let him vote. [SPEAKER_A]: Wait. Actually vote on what you think and we'll do the opposite? [SPEAKER_C]: Well, no, no, because that doesn't work for voting to the left. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm gonna vote to the left. So I'm gonna vote for my. [SPEAKER_D]: I just think you guys are cahoots and you're both werewolves. [SPEAKER_E]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_A]: Why would you. You have. I don't know. [SPEAKER_D]: You guys just give me this vibe that you guys are both werewolves. [SPEAKER_A]: You have my card. You know what I was. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I know. You're good. I. I feel like I. No one's confirmed her story. [SPEAKER_A]: 18 seconds. [SPEAKER_E]: Nobody can confirm my story. [SPEAKER_D]: She. [SPEAKER_C]: She kind of confirmed your. She confirmed yours. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. No one's confirmed hers. [SPEAKER_C]: I mean, yeah, but not many people can confirm the Seer. [SPEAKER_A]: And besides, I think because he stressed out so much, that would be an explanation there. [SPEAKER_D]: I think we vote. [SPEAKER_A]: We vote left."}

[SPEAKER_D]: Cool, cool, cool. You now switch. [SPEAKER_B]: I stole from him supposedly. Sounds good right now. [SPEAKER_D]: So this is possible. [SPEAKER_C]: This is possible. [SPEAKER_D]: But I feel like insomniac is the easiest way around it. [SPEAKER_B]: That's true. Right? Insomniac is the easiest way around it. Because even if she was actually. But even if she was actually the insomniac, she could wake up with something else and still say she's insomniac. [SPEAKER_E]: I would know if I swapped her or not. [SPEAKER_B]: That's true. [SPEAKER_E]: So did you claim that you are the inside? [SPEAKER_C]: I woke up as the insomniac. [SPEAKER_B]: So then he switched us to. If he switched. [SPEAKER_E]: I switched someone. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. 100. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I switched someone. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, even if he did switch somebody, you can't switch from the inside. Will claim you all the inside. [SPEAKER_B]: So he has to switch. He has to switch. [SPEAKER_D]: Exactly. [SPEAKER_B]: Unless she's lying. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, she's a wild card. [SPEAKER_E]: Sensei. Sensei. Sensual. Hey, guys, I'm over by the ramp. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, who sent. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, it's. [SPEAKER_C]: I told Matt. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, I know. He was texting me. Okay, we're gonna Pause. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, yeah, pause. [SPEAKER_B]: Want to mute which one? [SPEAKER_C]: One, one. [SPEAKER_D]: A friend here. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, One of our friends. Oh, cool. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, yeah, I'm following the four people. Let's add a fifth. [SPEAKER_B]: Add a fifth. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, I played with him before, I think. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, you've played with Matt before. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, I'm so excited. I can fix my Madame Zostra. That's exciting. And no, I play that game for Co Op. Because you can play. You can teach them in the beginning, and then hopefully they just don't become the traitor and have to do it all by themselves. Oh, Oiler's jersey. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, they'll just have to sign a waiver and everything. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: How'd he get in? The door. I thought the doors were locked. [SPEAKER_B]: No, the middle door there is locked. Is unlocked. And number eight down that hallway is supposed to be unlocked all night. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, for us. Okay, that makes sense. [SPEAKER_B]: And really, you can go through the Fantasyland Hotel. It's always unlocked. [SPEAKER_D]: There you go. Unfortunately, I think even with the bonus pause time, I still have no idea what's going on. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, there's no discussion happening right now. Oh, no. [SPEAKER_D]: I know. I'm just even in my own head. [SPEAKER_E]: If anything, I'm forgetting what was happening. I'm, like, going back. I'm losing info every second. Hey. Hey, folks. [SPEAKER_D]: Hey. [SPEAKER_B]: Hello. [SPEAKER_C]: Matt. This is Alana. She's our new friend. [SPEAKER_D]: Hello. This is Max. [SPEAKER_B]: Hello. [SPEAKER_D]: I actually saw her friend is debatable. I'm not trusting anyone. [SPEAKER_C]: Before I got here, she's our new friend and we started out with one night. So we'll see how she feels at the end of this fair. [SPEAKER_B]: We'll see if she comes back. [SPEAKER_E]: Let's make some room for him. [SPEAKER_B]: You already live in Edmonton, right? [SPEAKER_D]: Absolutely. [SPEAKER_B]: You live in Edmonton, right? [SPEAKER_D]: Do I? [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, yeah, absolutely. [SPEAKER_B]: If you want a comfy one, there's comfy ones over here still. Yeah, whatever. Okay, sounds good. If you give up. Okay, it's number six, I think. Keep pulling. Look at the pack. [SPEAKER_C]: Is like. [SPEAKER_B]: No, no. [SPEAKER_D]: Chad thinks we should add a new character in. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, we. [SPEAKER_B]: We have to unpause. [SPEAKER_C]: Unpause. [SPEAKER_D]: Unpause. Okay. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: So this is possible. [SPEAKER_B]: This is very possible. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you switch them? [SPEAKER_E]: I did. [SPEAKER_D]: So here's the thing. I. [SPEAKER_B]: You switched us. You 100% switched us. [SPEAKER_E]: You two have been switched. [SPEAKER_B]: I was still the wrong one. [SPEAKER_E]: Yes. [SPEAKER_D]: You guys been switched. In the beginning, he said you guys switched. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I can't switch. It's someone with myself. Yeah, so I switched. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, so you're implying then that this. [SPEAKER_B]: This happened? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, yes. [SPEAKER_B]: But I'm still. So here's my thing is. [SPEAKER_D]: But hers is a wild card. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay. It's. It's. I agree with this. But you were. [SPEAKER_D]: I was a seer. [SPEAKER_B]: I was 100%. [SPEAKER_D]: Did I forget to look? [SPEAKER_B]: Yes. [SPEAKER_E]: I honestly think we're good this game. [SPEAKER_C]: I. I think so. I look as fuck. [SPEAKER_E]: What makes me trust her is that she. She came out and was very confident that she was herself. Even after I said there's a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: Trying to stay alive. And there's no information out. Insomniac's easy way out. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Because it's just no one can confirm it especially. And if she wants to be. She wants to stay alive. No one's gonna kill someone they have a sure thing about. [SPEAKER_B]: It's true. [SPEAKER_D]: I always wonder why can I do that? [SPEAKER_C]: So there's a 50. 50 chance that I'm a werewolf or I'm a Tanner or insomniac. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, but you're not. We're not on your case. So you're not changing your story. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm not changing my story. [SPEAKER_B]: I think we're good. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm gonna vote that we're the way we are. [SPEAKER_E]: I think we're good too. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay. [SPEAKER_E]: And if there's a werewolf here, I'm impressed. [SPEAKER_C]: Really impressed. [SPEAKER_D]: Sound.

I think you're a robber and you rob from Mitchell. Which is really funny because I switched you guys. [SPEAKER_C]: Fuck. Is he actually the werewolf at the. [SPEAKER_D]: Beginning of the round? He was. [SPEAKER_C]: I honestly did like, copycat into the drum because I was like, then I know I'm good. So I guess I'm a werewolf now. I guess so. For me. You switched us? [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't know what else to do then. Well, okay, hold on. Could they both be werewolves? [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Let'S play that out. If they're both werewolves, then Justin didn't switch anybody. I'm still good. You said both. Who's the both you're talking about? You and you and Justin. [SPEAKER_B]: The boys. [SPEAKER_C]: The boys. The were boys. You and me are good. I think you probably are believable. [SPEAKER_D]: And I. And I saw. I saw Mitchell's werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Have we confirmed his role yet? No, no. [SPEAKER_B]: He's coming up swinging though. I believe is confident. [SPEAKER_C]: I believe him too. [SPEAKER_B]: Could we only have like one roll that confirms because, like, who can confirm the Seer? Who sears the Seer? Yeah. Copycat can see the Seer. But then, like, if you're claiming Seer. [SPEAKER_C]: When the Seer are you gonna meet or are you like, not. I don't think you're the troublemaker. I think you're trying to, like. I think he's trying to werewolf me into. I'm a werewolf now, but I'm not. I don't think I am. And even if I am, like, I have to play like, I like that. [SPEAKER_D]: So. So we vote for Mitchell because Justin's on the fence for me. [SPEAKER_B]: Sure, we can vote for Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: So wait, why is it me? I thought I got swapped. [SPEAKER_D]: No, we're going. If he's lying about being a troublemaker. You actually didn't get swapped. [SPEAKER_C]: I think if we. Do you think he's lying if he's a werewolf? If we go that route, I think we have to vote for Justin then. [SPEAKER_B]: No, let's kill Mitch. I'm on board to kill Mitch. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm voting Justin. [SPEAKER_D]: He was on board pretty quick. [SPEAKER_B]: That's cause I actually didn't switch anybody. I went like this when I woke. [SPEAKER_C]: Up with a trollmaker. Shady. I think we have to vote for Justin. I think we have to vote for Justin. [SPEAKER_B]: You're gonna give Mitchell the win, I promise you. [SPEAKER_A]: Don't vote Justin because he's actually one minute remaining. [SPEAKER_D]: But then, if Mitch is the lone. [SPEAKER_C]: Werewolf, I think they're the. I think they're both. I really, really think they're both. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm gonna lose this game because Paul can't make up his mind. [SPEAKER_D]: What if he's a Tanner? [SPEAKER_C]: We can't make up a mess. I think Justin robbed from me. I'm voting Justin first. [SPEAKER_D]: What if he's a Tanner, though? [SPEAKER_C]: He isn't. [SPEAKER_A]: He robbed from me. [SPEAKER_C]: That makes so much sense. And this is why we've been giggling, because we both know that he robbed his Tanner place. [SPEAKER_B]: Chad, they suck. [SPEAKER_C]: I 100%. He. [SPEAKER_A]: He robbed. Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_D]: Are we ready? [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. We killed Mitchell. He just said he's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: I was the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Paul, ready? [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_A]: I got robbed. [SPEAKER_C]: Don't let us get robbed again. [SPEAKER_B]: What do you fault this? [SPEAKER_C]: Do you think he's Tanner? I think he either did rob Mitchell or he's Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, I think I'm the troublemaker and I don't switch anybody. [SPEAKER_C]: Which one do we vote? [SPEAKER_B]: Justin or do we vote me? Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: We vote Justin. [SPEAKER_A]: Time is up, everyone. [SPEAKER_C]: Three."}

[SPEAKER_C]: Let's hear some information. Werewolf boys, over here. [SPEAKER_D]: Werewolf boys. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, you too. Not you anymore. [SPEAKER_D]: Wow. [SPEAKER_B]: I was a robbery. [SPEAKER_D]: No, you can't be the robber because I robbed you. [SPEAKER_B]: What? [SPEAKER_C]: What did you rob? [SPEAKER_D]: Uh, he was the drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: This is garbage. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. Okay. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm actually feeling really good for the first time ever about being this role. I was a drunk. And those two are making me feel happy about that because I think there's some bad shit over there. I don't know what they are, but it's making me think. I'm good. I think I'm on your team. But you switched me. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, but there. [SPEAKER_C]: Were you drunk? [SPEAKER_B]: Yes. [SPEAKER_C]: So that's good. Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: That is really sick. [SPEAKER_C]: Right? [SPEAKER_D]: So it's a switch and then the drunk, right? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, it's a Tanner Werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: I have no information but that. [SPEAKER_C]: But you have a. You have. And you. You started as drum crate. You didn't start as copycat. [SPEAKER_D]: So I. So then I got Mitchell's card, and then Mitchell got rid of my card. [SPEAKER_C]: Who did you rob? You didn't. [SPEAKER_E]: You didn't rob. [SPEAKER_D]: I didn't. I didn't rob. No. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: No. Susan, I'm just trying to. [SPEAKER_C]: So your card is in the middle. [SPEAKER_D]: So my Card's in the middle. [SPEAKER_C]: Was it. [SPEAKER_D]: It was Werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, Sid, we vote Tyler. I didn't switch anybody. Sorry. Justin's tanner, I think. I'm pretty sure he's tanner. I believe you. If you duped me, good for you. Let's vote. [SPEAKER_B]: I copycatted into a werewolf and I joined Tyler at night. You might be a werewolf with us. If you point to the card, I'll tell you what to do. [SPEAKER_C]: He's eating. I hate. I hate. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, I hate you. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, my God. [SPEAKER_D]: But then really, what if there's also a tanner at this end? [SPEAKER_B]: It's only a 33% chance, so it's really slim. And I. I do think voting for Tyler is the right thing to do. Or in that regard, she's gaining her trust right now. [SPEAKER_D]: Right now. But then what if one of us is a tanner? There could be a Tanner over here. [SPEAKER_C]: It's not you, though. [SPEAKER_D]: You sure? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: I just want to know which one you exchange with, that's all. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm not even sure if I want a point. [SPEAKER_B]: I won't react. I won't react. Cool. [SPEAKER_D]: See, you like the middle card. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm happy with however you vote. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay. All right. [SPEAKER_C]: I think that means you're good still. [SPEAKER_E]: I think I'm good. I'm voting with you, Paul. [SPEAKER_C]: Can we vote Justin? Really? Yes, because I switched them and I really think Tyler was the werewolf. So even if they're both Justin. [SPEAKER_D]: So you drill. If you did switch, that means Justin's the lonely werewolf left. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you wake up alone? You have to tell us. [SPEAKER_D]: I woke up with Justin. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: So Justin's a werewolf and my. And if you did switch me, my role's gone and I'm good now. [SPEAKER_C]: No, because he's you. I switched to werewolves. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, you switched us. [SPEAKER_D]: I thought you switched. [SPEAKER_C]: No, I switched to werewolves. So we vote. [SPEAKER_A]: One minute remaining. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, but you might be fucking. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I'm team with you. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, Yeah, I think it statistically. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I'm with you. Especially if there's two werewolves, then I can't be a werewolf. I mean, I may be a Tanner, but if I'm not gonna. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, no, I. Cuz I copycatted into a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, yeah, I might be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: But I. Yeah, you're best to play like you're not. So who. Which one you pick? Doesn't matter. [SPEAKER_E]: Justin. Cuz he was trying to deceive me. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, he was trying to tyrant you. [SPEAKER_B]: We should kill Paul. We don't want to kill Mitchell. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. Yeah. Casey drunked into the Tanner, no into. [SPEAKER_A]: A only 30 seconds. [SPEAKER_B]: He can go down with us. It's fine. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: You think I'm mine or two he's in your head. [SPEAKER_E]: I didn't look at that card. [SPEAKER_D]: We already. [SPEAKER_A]: Time is up, everyone."}

[SPEAKER_E]: We got him. [SPEAKER_C]: Someone else's turn to share. [SPEAKER_A]: No lies. [SPEAKER_E]: No lies. Let's play a truth game. A truth round. [SPEAKER_A]: Truth only. [SPEAKER_B]: Truth only. [SPEAKER_A]: Truth only. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, I can. I'm still in then. [SPEAKER_A]: Truth only. [SPEAKER_E]: Truth only. [SPEAKER_C]: Robert Mitchell. [SPEAKER_D]: I can't. [SPEAKER_E]: I can't say. I can't say. [SPEAKER_C]: Technically, lot lying. [SPEAKER_E]: I can't say. Sorry. [SPEAKER_C]: Does that mean he was a werewolf? Doesn't want to just oust himself right away. [SPEAKER_D]: Did you rock for me? Because if. If so, then now you're not the Tanner anymore. [SPEAKER_A]: You call him that, you're calling that shot? Wait, what? You're saying Mitch Troublemade those? [SPEAKER_D]: No, I did then. [SPEAKER_A]: But if I robbed Paul, then you were two rolls. It doesn't make sense. [SPEAKER_E]: His own story involves him being two rolls. [SPEAKER_A]: Yep. He just claimed two rolls. Amazing. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, that's another level. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh. [SPEAKER_E]: His own story requires him being two rolls. [SPEAKER_A]: Oh, what a twist. What a twist. Absolute twist. [SPEAKER_E]: Broke Justin's brain. [SPEAKER_A]: Is it just me? Are these five minutes going so much quicker than normal? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. Can I need, like a second one of you guys? [SPEAKER_A]: All right, Tyler, how did you see cards in the middle? [SPEAKER_C]: I saw cards in the middle with a seer. [SPEAKER_A]: Cool. All right. This is my time to shine, baby. I was never the robber. I was the copycat. [SPEAKER_E]: This is a fucking. This is a dark round. I can tell you that. [SPEAKER_C]: Mitchell. Yes. One thing I can tell you is Justin is lying. Yeah, I believe that because I saw a copycat in this location. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: And I saw a werewolf in that location. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. That's making me feel a lot better. [SPEAKER_A]: I was lying. I was the Robert from the beginning. This is a no lie round. I took a little time off, though. [SPEAKER_E]: No lie round. I was a drunk. Bam. [SPEAKER_D]: Convenient question. [SPEAKER_E]: Very. That's why I'm saying it now. No. These two are both shady. You know that. Somehow, some way, these motherfuckers. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, shady. [SPEAKER_E]: Which means. Boom. So therefore, Tyler. [SPEAKER_C]: So it's either the troublemaker or the right. [SPEAKER_A]: Can I propose an alternative? [SPEAKER_E]: I'm gonna vote for whoever you want me to vote. I am your. [SPEAKER_A]: Can I propose a counter thing that I think is happening here that Paul and I both know is true? One of us is one of these roles, so you could still be the Tanner new. I think that's exactly what happened here, Paul. One of us robbed from the other person. [SPEAKER_D]: I think we vote Justin. I think Justin's bad. [SPEAKER_E]: Why? [SPEAKER_D]: Because what he's trying to. He thinks I'm something that I'm not. [SPEAKER_A]: I think you're. [SPEAKER_D]: And so he's trying to make me think that I'm a bad role now, which I'm not. [SPEAKER_E]: You're good. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, I'm 100% good. Trust me. [SPEAKER_A]: It's definitely seen that way. [SPEAKER_D]: Totally valid. So what's the good role then? Totally valid. [SPEAKER_C]: What's your role then if you're good? [SPEAKER_D]: It doesn't matter. I know, I know. Hold on, let me think. [SPEAKER_C]: If I should tell you, like if you were the troublemaker one minute. You could have switched cards, which matters. If you were the robber, you could have robbed somebody, which matters. [SPEAKER_D]: Justin didn't rob a bad person because there's no bad role out there except him. You might be bad. Which. Which two. Did you see that? And that? Okay, okay. I was the troublemaker from the beginning. My two role claim. [SPEAKER_B]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_D]: I wanted information. [SPEAKER_E]: Who are you thinking we vote for this? [SPEAKER_C]: I hate this round. [SPEAKER_E]: I wouldn't believe him. And I wouldn't believe him. And I'm voting for whoever you want. [SPEAKER_C]: So who do you switch then? [SPEAKER_D]: I switched you two. [SPEAKER_E]: Cool. [SPEAKER_D]: Dead serious. And Justin's the only one who's being shady in my book, so I think we vote for him. I think like the only other thing you could think I was is the Tanner. So don't Vote for me. Vote for Justin. [SPEAKER_E]: Who am I voting for? [SPEAKER_B]: Time is up. Everyone. Three. [SPEAKER_A]: Paul Robinson."}

I'm, like, hot. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fever. All right, so no one announced the role, so everyone failed on that point. So let's recap. [SPEAKER_B]: What do you have to figure out? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. Who's the roof and what they do? Who's the werewolf? Yeah, werewolves. Oh, well, there could be one. We don't know. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm gonna say that Katie was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: That's crazy. The drag. [SPEAKER_B]: I just. You just feeling that? I'm just feeling. Vibing it. She's giving me them hairy vibes. Well, that's outrageous, because I don't even have. What are you then? [SPEAKER_C]: What did you do? [SPEAKER_B]: I was just an innocent little villager. Oh, really? Because I was a villager, I think I wouldn't play. I think I would have known. We never opened our eyes. I haven't said I would have known. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, I want to know who was the robber or the troublemaker and what they did. I have some. Yes, please. And I don't know how to say it. So it's starting controversy. Oh, 100%. I was the villager. I was a villager. [SPEAKER_B]: Already called him three. [SPEAKER_C]: I know. Katie or Audrey. [SPEAKER_B]: No, I'm a villager. [SPEAKER_C]: But I said 100%. He did say 100%. I said 100%. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, 101%. That doesn't step back. [SPEAKER_C]: You exceeded the limit. That doesn't make sense. That's not even math. You're looking kind of weird. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm an English teacher. Obviously not a bad teacher. [SPEAKER_C]: So who robbed. Here's the thing. Well, yeah, who robbed a new. I think Dylan made Robert. Who made trouble. [SPEAKER_B]: I believe that. [SPEAKER_C]: Who did make trouble? I mean, it's possible. [SPEAKER_B]: What did you do, Dylan? [SPEAKER_C]: What did you guys. Do we have any seals? [SPEAKER_B]: Dylan, what did you do? [SPEAKER_C]: We do have a seal. [SPEAKER_B]: Why can't you play along? Why can't you be cool? [SPEAKER_C]: This is how you play. Dane wants to speak. I want to speak. I'm the seer, and I looked at your card and you're a werewolf, and you're 100% lying. Okay, whoa. Okay. I just want to call something out here. I just want to call something out here. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, you're not a villager anymore. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm 100% a villager, which makes me think he was a werewolf and he saw cedar in the middle. [SPEAKER_B]: No, I think Brett's a werewolf now. I'm sorry. [SPEAKER_C]: What the f. You have? Well, thank you, Audrey. I'm just a stupid villager. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm a villager. I'm a villager. [SPEAKER_C]: Listen, why are you helping the werewolves out? Listen, I'm not helping you. If you were actually a seer, that means Ed's now a seer. Because I was making some trouble last night. All right? [SPEAKER_B]: What's her name? Get out of her. I was a villain. [SPEAKER_C]: All right? You were a villager. I wasn't. So we're a villager, bro. [SPEAKER_B]: No, you are not. [SPEAKER_C]: We just. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay. I'm a villager. I'm a villager. I'm a vil. I think you're. You two are both werewolves. [SPEAKER_C]: Wait, no. What if you switched in? What were you? I was the seer. I saw. You're a werewolf, which you still are. But I'm a villager. That's what. I don't get your plate, Cuz if you werewolf. That means he's a werewolf now. But then if Brett was a werewolf, he would have. Well, that means he's not a werewolf. That means he's not. I'm now a villager. I'm now a villager. That means he's not aware. And ed's now. Why wouldn't he cry? Because my car was a villager. Unless someone swapped my car. [SPEAKER_B]: Says you. [SPEAKER_C]: But I said 100%. Ed and Dan. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, so Ed and Dan switched. You were the seer. That means you're the seer. So you could be a werewolf if you have his car. [SPEAKER_C]: But he was. Unless he was lying. Yeah, yeah, he was lying about being a villager, but he's saying he solved my vermouth and I'm a villager, so I don't know why we trust him. [SPEAKER_B]: Because I trust Dan implicitly. Thank you. [SPEAKER_C]: I built up a reputation. YouTube fans are laughing at you guys. [SPEAKER_B]: You're getting played I'm a villager. They know I'm a villager. [SPEAKER_C]: I think the audience knows from all the videos I've been in. So we got very trustworthy. We got four people claiming a minute. [SPEAKER_B]: And a half left. [SPEAKER_C]: We've got four claims for villager. There's only two. So who's the robber? Do we not have one? [SPEAKER_B]: I guess that's what I asked two minutes ago. [SPEAKER_C]: Who were you guys? Why do you guys. [SPEAKER_B]: A villager? Audrey and I are villagers. I don't believe you for a second. You're not. You're too upset to be. You're too animated to not believe. [SPEAKER_C]: But I feel like I'd be more upset if I really was a villager. [SPEAKER_B]: You seem pretty upset if I really was. So you're not actually a villager. What are you? [SPEAKER_C]: I'm a villager. Are you twisting. All right, so Dan is 100, not a werewolf. That's not true. Because if he was a werewolf and I switched, then he could be like, all right, Ed's the werewolf, but he's waiting for you to say, oh, I didn't really switch you guys. All right, I lied. I didn't really switch you guys. It doesn't matter. I've gotten. [SPEAKER_B]: Wait, you're lying. Were you the trouble? Why were you lying? [SPEAKER_C]: I was in trouble. You're in trouble. [SPEAKER_B]: You were only supposed to cause trouble last night. [SPEAKER_C]: I switched them. [SPEAKER_B]: What a first game, not daytime. I'm so confused. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, he switched us. Okay, Bomb squad. I. I can't use the word bomb squad. We don't allow bomb squad in this game. What did Dylan just say? Bomb squad. What does that mean? It'll all be explained on today's All About Dylan. Welcome to All About Dylan, the only show that's a hundred percent all about Dylan. Now today's episode is brought to you by buyaboat.com. need a boat? Then go to buyabot.com. stock is better than buyabot.com. now, Dylan said the word bomb squad. What does bomb squad mean exactly? Well, I'm about to explain it to you. Basically, in our household, sometimes we say stuff a little ironically or sarcastically, and we can't tell if the other person's serious. We'll be like, are you serious? You really do like Green Day. Or are you goofing me? That's what we'll be like. We'll be like, are you goofing me or what? So we developed a safe word in our house that we can never break. So if we say the word bomb squad, it means that we're being 100% honest. No lie, no joke, no irony. So I could be like, I don't like chicken, bomb squad. I swear, I don't like chicken. That means a hundred percent I don't like chicken. And I'm not just goofing and gagging you around. So Dylan used the word bomb squad in the middle of our one night werewolf game, which beforehand we banned. Because this whole game is about telling who's lying and who's telling the truth. So if you bring out our safe word, it kind of destroys the game because you could be like, are you the werewolf? Tell me, bomb squad. And. And you would have to be like, oh, bomb squad, I am the werewolf. Like, you can't. It's a thing that can't be broken in our household, so it cannot be used in the game. And that's what bomb squad means. So thanks for watching all about do. We'll see you next time. Bye. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm so confused. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, switched us, but okay. Bomb squad. I can't get somewhere in bomb squad. We don't allow bomb squad in this game. Okay, so now I'm a seer. Dan is a villager. We're being so played. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm saying 100%, though. Audrey and I are the villagers. [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, my God, yes. [SPEAKER_C]: Were there three villagers? [SPEAKER_B]: I was the villager. [SPEAKER_C]: You gotta be on my side. They're claiming villagers. One of these three is a werewolf. And you are a werewolf. I think. [SPEAKER_B]: And you are. Well, then we should definitely vote for Brett in seven seconds because I think. [SPEAKER_C]: Audrey and Katie are the werewolves. Yeah, I think you're exactly. [SPEAKER_B]: No. Okay, well, it doesn't matter. That's not enough time. Oh, this minute. [SPEAKER_C]: Wait, do we have any. Can we point it."}

Troublemaker, close your eyes. Drunk, wake up and exchange your card with a card from the center. Drunk, close your eyes. Everyone, keep your eyes closed and reach out and move your card around slightly. Everyone, wake up. [SPEAKER_B]: Seer, what you see? Seer, what you see? I saw that Dan was a Mason. That is accurate. So who else did you see? I didn't see anybody. I was the only one. So there's a Mason in the middle. Unless someone swapped it. Unless the drunk took it. Yeah. Caroline, what were you doing? [SPEAKER_C]: What were you doing? [SPEAKER_B]: I'll wait this out. See what other people say. [SPEAKER_C]: This was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: I will say whatever you were. It does know that, bro. It does not. [SPEAKER_C]: So were you the troublemaker? [SPEAKER_B]: I was the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: So you were the seer? [SPEAKER_B]: I was the seer. So you're now the seer. [SPEAKER_C]: What were you? [SPEAKER_B]: I feel like we just gave Dylan a lot of information without making him tell us anything. Well, because he's playing the whole I'm a werewolf, and so I want him to. I want him to say that Ed's now the word. What'd you do, Audrey? [SPEAKER_C]: I'm a villager again. [SPEAKER_B]: But what were you? Cause then now Ed's the card. Yeah, I'm what you were, apparently. So it doesn't help you to not say. Well, I think he's worried about me pulling that thing where I'm like, oh, I swapped you. Oh, no, I didn't. [SPEAKER_C]: Because you do that all the time. [SPEAKER_B]: I did it. I will. Okay, then. I feel like I should say this. I didn't swap you with Ed. I swapped you with someone else. But I did swap you. Who'd you swap me with? Why does that matter? I'm just wondering. Oh, I want you to say what your role is, because I might know who certain people are. [SPEAKER_C]: Because you're the robber and you stole from them. Maybe then you'd be swapped back. [SPEAKER_B]: We'll see, guys. We'll see how this plans out. Oh, my God. Why did you. [SPEAKER_C]: Why can't you just participate? Why Won't you just participate? That's how you play the game. [SPEAKER_B]: On the other hand, why is Brett causing all this trouble? He's not a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Are you supposed to. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm trying to get that clickbait views. I mean, it is all about that. Okay, I won't caus trouble. I swapped you and Dan. You swapped me and Dan? Swapped you and Dan? [SPEAKER_C]: Dan. What were you? Dan? [SPEAKER_B]: So now you're a Mason. Unless he's a wolf boy. [SPEAKER_C]: So then what is Dan? [SPEAKER_B]: I don't think that makes Dan. Am I a wolf? Oh, wait, no. You don't know. That's all you. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, is Dan a werewolf now? [SPEAKER_B]: I saw that Dan was a Mason, but did you? [SPEAKER_C]: Right? He said he was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: You said you're a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: He said. I think that makes Dan a werewolf. But he's smiling when he doesn't. [SPEAKER_B]: But he's. Did you actually. I don't believe him. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you actually. [SPEAKER_B]: He's smiling. I have someone under the table ticket. I feel like maybe Brett and Dylan are both werewolves. What? [SPEAKER_C]: Are they even together? [SPEAKER_B]: We need everything. No, I was the troublemaker. You can watch the video when we. When I upload it. Can I go just check you real quick? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I'm just gonna check real quick. Is this a live stream? [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, no. I have to edit this stuff. So it'll be a while, but then you'll know that I swapped Dylan and him. [SPEAKER_C]: He's gonna edit himself swapping Dylan and him. I can't trust anything anymore. [SPEAKER_B]: But that's what happened. So if Dylan wasn't werewolf, then it's now Dan. If Dylan's lying about that, it wouldn't matter because I was the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Doesn't anybody care what I am? [SPEAKER_B]: You said villager. [SPEAKER_C]: I know, but why do you guys believe me? [SPEAKER_B]: Because we're not gonna get. No one else is. We're not gonna get the real answer out of you anyway. You're just gonna say villager overhound. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, that's cause I am. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm just telling the truth. [SPEAKER_C]: I just want to have a fun one. [SPEAKER_B]: We're gonna get pretty boring. Hey, next. Next video that villager is gonna be out. [SPEAKER_C]: I won't get. I still get the villager in the playlist. [SPEAKER_B]: Click that, like, button to get that villager out of here. [SPEAKER_C]: Do you make, like, playlists on your channel or. No? [SPEAKER_B]: I guess I will for this next one. Skip this one. No, watch the whole video. Oh, yeah, click on my ads. Yeah. What are we talking about? Ads? So he's the werewolf now? I Was the werewolf. I looked in the middle. I saw another villager. So if you saw a villager, that means she's. [SPEAKER_C]: No, you're fucking. He's so lying. I'm a villager. What a sly dog. What a sly dog. [SPEAKER_B]: What would that help? [SPEAKER_C]: Throwing me under the bus? [SPEAKER_B]: Because I did tr. So that means Dan's now the world, so why doesn't matter. But. So you're saying you saw a villager? I wanted Audrey to have a little bit of fun. So that means you're the robber or the drunk. Are you the drunk or robber? [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, wait, did you really? Oh, you switched me. Wait, wait. What are you so. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, so wait a minute. She could have been the drunk. Just wanting. [SPEAKER_C]: Probably not, though. [SPEAKER_B]: Dylan, what is you actually. [SPEAKER_C]: Trouble. [SPEAKER_B]: I did troublemake them. Those 200, 101. Oh, that doesn't add up though. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, it's over. 100. [SPEAKER_B]: 101% is very unbelievable. I'm just saying. [SPEAKER_C]: Sounds like a very specific number. [SPEAKER_B]: It's a werewolf number. [SPEAKER_C]: So wait, Dylan, were you actually the werewolf? [SPEAKER_B]: I was. Cut yourself and showed. So now Brett and Dan are werewolves? Why am I a werewolf? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, why is. [SPEAKER_B]: No, if. If you're calling me werewolf, that means. [SPEAKER_C]: Dylan would also be werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: It seems like Dylan and Audrey were werewolf, and. And Dylan oddly accidentally blew her cover. [SPEAKER_C]: Wait, no, wait. If Dylan was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: I know, that's what I'm saying. He accidentally said I looked in the mirror. Lying about that. Yeah. So he's saying he's the only werewolf. But if he's not the werewolf, why would he call? Dan's the werewolf. Why would he call? If one of us is the werewolf, maybe and Audrey is the werewolf, then everyone should just vote for Audrey. But I. But I feel like we should. I'm not the werewolf of a village. [SPEAKER_C]: He just doesn't want to be voted. [SPEAKER_B]: We know you're the werewolf, but I. [SPEAKER_C]: Also maybe think that Audrey is guilty now because she's so passive. [SPEAKER_B]: Anyone got any last confessions? These are my confessions. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm just throwing out there. No one's asked me what I was. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, not curious. Not curious, not interested. Katie, are you a werewolf? What are you. 30 seconds. Where are you? Katie? You're a werewolf. Who were you? [SPEAKER_C]: I got shit faced last night, so. [SPEAKER_B]: All right, let me know. You're probably Mason now. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, probably. There was. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't know. I'm voting for Dan. I don't care what you're doing. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm voting for Audrey. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm voting for Audrey. All right, fine. You're right. I'm gonna vote for Dan. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, but why me? I'm the villager. No, that's what villagers say. Yeah, it is what villagers say. [SPEAKER_B]: We got five seconds. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, Audrey, these are my confessions. I'm fine. Dylan, you're playing this dare."}

We got six minutes to figure this out. All right. With the curse. [SPEAKER_B]: Would you like me to start? [SPEAKER_C]: Yes. See? Or what'd you do if you claim villager, I'm running out. He's not the villager because I am. [SPEAKER_B]: We're all villagers, so I was the robber. And I took Dylan's card. And Dylan was the seer. So don't let him pull any mole. I switched our cards. [SPEAKER_C]: So sounds like something two werewolves would say. Say. [SPEAKER_B]: Wait. Saying you're both werewolves. [SPEAKER_C]: What did you see? [SPEAKER_B]: Come on. It's so hard. Cuz I don't want anybody to feel me move, so I have to do like, what's next to me? [SPEAKER_C]: Was there a troublemaker? So we're really in a bubble, right? [SPEAKER_B]: That would be hilarious. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, I'll say. I hate my role. Oh, just a werewolf. I hate it too. I was the drunk. I was the drunk. I switched him from the middle. [SPEAKER_B]: Which one? [SPEAKER_C]: The metal one. Oh, no, no. [SPEAKER_B]: He was the seer. Oh, so I can. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, what were you. [SPEAKER_B]: Thanks for asking. Sorry, that was really loud. Watch the second video. There was only one Mason, so there's another Mason card in the middle. [SPEAKER_C]: Wait, so. Oh, you're a Mason. [SPEAKER_B]: I was all by myself. [SPEAKER_C]: So would you. You're claiming troublemaker. What did you do? Ed your troublemaker. He's like what's left on the board. Whose cars did you switch? [SPEAKER_B]: They're over there. [SPEAKER_C]: You're being very suspicious. So you. You explain what you did first. I think they're too. Wait, do we have an insomniac? Well, I was the insomnia. [SPEAKER_B]: No, you just fed him the one that. [SPEAKER_C]: I was the insomniac. And when I woke up. I was the Mason, which means that Dan switched. That makes a lot of sense because I did switch those two cards, so we're out of the running. [SPEAKER_B]: And so wait, were you actually the insomniac, though? But wait, we don't know that she was actually. Oh, wait. [SPEAKER_C]: I mean, if he. If you believe. They could have been two werewolves. That happened to God. [SPEAKER_B]: So I was definitely amazing. I think that you're the werewolf then. [SPEAKER_C]: Why? [SPEAKER_B]: Because if there's no werewolves, laying the chance to go. [SPEAKER_C]: But I could be a Mason. [SPEAKER_B]: You could. But out of all of us, you know, kill me. [SPEAKER_C]: You said you're the troublemaker. I'm the troublemaker. I switched these two, and they're in this lineup. So what? It sounds like. It sounds like if everyone's telling truth, that we have no werewolves and they're saying the chip. [SPEAKER_B]: There's these guys. [SPEAKER_C]: There's two thirds of a chance of me stealing that. [SPEAKER_B]: Thank you, guys. [SPEAKER_C]: But if you guys kill me and I am the Mason, then we all. One third. No, two thirds. There were two in there. Yeah. Let's just say you were. I was the insomniac. Now I'm the Mason. Because now supposedly he's now the insomniac. I'm the troublemaker. He could have really switched someone else in this. Was trying to get Ed to say who. But if he was, then that would have been the time. You guys really. You guys really dunked your roles by just looking at each other. [SPEAKER_B]: I know. We're done. We can't. [SPEAKER_C]: Unless you guys. Unless you didn't really do that. [SPEAKER_B]: What? [SPEAKER_C]: So are we just playing the odds on Brett? What were you saying? What you said. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, I think I'm gonna vote for you. Sorry. [SPEAKER_C]: Why? [SPEAKER_B]: I was Mason, but now I'm the insomniac. [SPEAKER_C]: But we could have an actual werewolf in here. Lying werewolf in here. [SPEAKER_B]: Here. Longer. [SPEAKER_C]: So it's still one of you three, so. Yeah, but, like, you guys are backing each other when you both get werewolves. [SPEAKER_B]: We're not backing each other. We're literally relaying evidence of factual things that we saw on cards. [SPEAKER_C]: That sounds an awful lot like I'm a werewolf. You just say you're a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Are you? [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. I'm gonna vote for Brett. [SPEAKER_C]: Me, too. [SPEAKER_B]: Sorry. [SPEAKER_C]: But if you vote for me, we're gonna lose. [SPEAKER_B]: Only for the Mason. If you're either of the werewolves. You can't say 100% that you're not a werewolf, though. So we have no reason not to vote for you. [SPEAKER_C]: If you vote for me, you all lose. [SPEAKER_B]: If we lose. Well it doesn't matter, we lose it. [SPEAKER_C]: No, because if we all vote to the right, we could win. [SPEAKER_B]: If you're a werewolf, then we wouldn't. [SPEAKER_C]: There's no werewolves over here. [SPEAKER_B]: If there's a werewolf in play and we don't kill it, then the werewolf wins. So we have to kill you. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm sorry, you guys are just banking on me being the werewolf. Two thirds, that's 2:30. The 66.6 repeating percent chance. But like here's what I'm saying is I feel like we're being played by someone. He could. He could. Really? Well, I guess some our stories lined up real nice. Look, I'm in a tough spot here because you guys are voting for me. Yeah, I want to win the game still. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, I'm guessing werewolf, so. [SPEAKER_C]: Because if you guys all vote for me, if you got it seems like I'm gonna lose no matter what. Well, no, because if you vote for me and I'm the Mason, the villagers lose. So you can't win unless we all vote to the right. That's not gonna happen. So you can't because then there's a chance of all of us. A 1 in 3 chance instead of a 2 and 3 maybe chance. Unless you two are alive, which you really might be. I know, that's why I feel like we're being played by two werewolves over here. Definitely possible. And you guys don't want to talk about that at all. We got him. Wowzers. Okay, well there's nothing I can do. [SPEAKER_B]: Really, is there no time to vote. We can cut it short. [SPEAKER_C]: Does that have to be unanimous? No, I just have to get the votes. I have to get the most votes. Okay. Okay, I guess we can vote. [SPEAKER_A]: Time is up, everyone."}

[SPEAKER_F]: What was the lie? [SPEAKER_D]: What was the lie? [SPEAKER_C]: She didn't even say anything. I just. I'm gonna tell you that I woke up. [SPEAKER_B]: So she's not a Tanner? Yeah, that's the only car that doesn't wake up. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, I know this much. She didn't wake up when I woke up. [SPEAKER_C]: What does that mean? [SPEAKER_B]: He's a werewolf too. [SPEAKER_C]: Were you a werewolf or. [SPEAKER_B]: Me too, but not when she woke up. Narrowing it down, I will say she did not wake up when I woke up. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, my God. Wait. She didn't wake up when I was awake either. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Not everybody could wake up. [SPEAKER_E]: Was your waking up changing of someone else waking up? [SPEAKER_F]: Well, she woke up when I woke up. I was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Why would you claim werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Or no, the other thing. [SPEAKER_B]: I have no idea what's going on. [SPEAKER_E]: He's little, in yellow and works for Universal. [SPEAKER_C]: He's a minion. [SPEAKER_B]: I have. Let's be honest. Tell him. What'd you do? No jokes. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, Be honest. [SPEAKER_B]: No, seriously, no jokes. [SPEAKER_C]: In a game of deception. Be honest. [SPEAKER_F]: I can't get away jokes right now. [SPEAKER_D]: Are you the minion? [SPEAKER_C]: Why are the minions in this? [SPEAKER_F]: Are you the minion? I was the werewolf, but I'm hoping someone. [SPEAKER_D]: I think you're the werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: I'm hoping someone troublemade me. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, so he's obviously not the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: I think he's a minion. [SPEAKER_C]: Because I was Minion. [SPEAKER_B]: Or Tina. I was the troublemaker, and I didn't touch his card. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, sorry. [SPEAKER_F]: He touched me. Not my card. [SPEAKER_B]: I touched him a lot. [SPEAKER_D]: He seriously wants to be voted. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, you're either tan or a minion. So, Dylan, go away. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, you're not getting anything. [SPEAKER_F]: No, it's an interesting strategy. [SPEAKER_B]: Or he could be a werewolf trying to play Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: Did anyone look at the cards in the middle? [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, I did all three of them. [SPEAKER_B]: Only. Only the werewolves could lead me. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, no one can do that. [SPEAKER_E]: All right, so no one knows what leads you. [SPEAKER_C]: Brett, what did you do? [SPEAKER_B]: I was a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: But you didn't. [SPEAKER_B]: I didn't touch his card, and no one woke up with me. [SPEAKER_C]: So who did you actually move two people's cards? Useful information. Dad, what did you do? [SPEAKER_D]: I slept a lot. I did wake up once, though. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: And nobody else got a glass of. [SPEAKER_E]: Water, went back to bed, you know? [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_C]: Were you Mason? [SPEAKER_D]: Yes, I was. Amazing. [SPEAKER_C]: But no one else was Mason. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I seriously was a Mason. I forgot. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, but no one else was Mason with you. [SPEAKER_B]: What you do, Katie? [SPEAKER_C]: I might be a Mason now. [SPEAKER_B]: What you do? [SPEAKER_C]: I just got a little tipsy last night, got hammered, and then passed out. [SPEAKER_D]: Why do I always forget what I am? I don't know. [SPEAKER_C]: But I don't know what I am now. [SPEAKER_B]: George, you're the only one. [SPEAKER_C]: I was the drunk. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, Because I didn't wake up. [SPEAKER_D]: I was the drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: So you're the Tanner Claiming Tanner. But I feel like normally you don't want to claim. I don't know why Brett's always the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_B]: I did. Oh, we did the shuffle. [SPEAKER_C]: True. [SPEAKER_B]: We played a game. [SPEAKER_C]: The cupid shuffle. [SPEAKER_B]: We played a game off camera where it happened to be the troublemaker before Trevor Maker. The shuffle maker. Hey, you can. If you had X ray vision, you'd see. [SPEAKER_F]: What did you do? [SPEAKER_C]: He claimed that he didn't wake up. [SPEAKER_B]: He's claiming Tanner, which is a weird claim. [SPEAKER_D]: I saw him get up and go to 7 11. [SPEAKER_C]: It's weird because he's claiming Tanner, which you don't normally claim, and then he's claiming werewolf, which you don't normally claim. You guys are messing with the system. You don't do that. [SPEAKER_A]: You just don't. [SPEAKER_E]: I guess we have, like, two minutes at 30. [SPEAKER_B]: You guys aren't tickling each other on the table. [SPEAKER_C]: You didn't do anything, though. I'm not giving you that information. [SPEAKER_B]: She can't really wake up. [SPEAKER_D]: I woke up and I'm A what's just you were me. [SPEAKER_C]: Is there a robber in play? Who else was a Mason? [SPEAKER_D]: No, there was no other Mason because I was the only one that woke up. [SPEAKER_F]: Hope you guys. There's nothing in it. [SPEAKER_C]: They just wake up to look at another. But they don't get to. They don't get. [SPEAKER_D]: There's a mason here, here or here. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, this one's a joint card now and then. [SPEAKER_D]: This is a mason. Or that's a Mason. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: So that makes you a mason. [SPEAKER_C]: Maybe if this was. If this one was here. [SPEAKER_B]: He just doesn't know. He knows. So. [SPEAKER_E]: All right, there's a 13 chance. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh my gosh. [SPEAKER_D]: You paused like. [SPEAKER_C]: Like, is it time? He's like. [SPEAKER_E]: I might pause this for a second, give them more time to turn against me. [SPEAKER_B]: Sure. Absolutely. [SPEAKER_D]: So much. Not werewolves. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I'm thinking so much. Not both are so much. [SPEAKER_B]: Maybe. [SPEAKER_D]: But she said nobody woke up with her. [SPEAKER_C]: What if. What if all the werewolves are in the middle and like, one's a minion, one's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: Werewolf or werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, I forgot to say, if you're a good liar, if you're a lone minion, you want someone else to die. [SPEAKER_D]: But that's a good cop out for a person. [SPEAKER_B]: Actually, I switch Pete and Katie and it sounds like they're both villages. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, so now you. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, have a drunk card. Drunk? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, because it happened before I. [SPEAKER_B]: It sounds like they're both. [SPEAKER_D]: I'll be drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: So I was what? You were. [SPEAKER_D]: I'll be drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: You're amazing. [SPEAKER_B]: All right, you guys have the two most boring cards of. Stop talking. [SPEAKER_E]: What are the mechanics of these cards? [SPEAKER_A]: Stuck More the real one minute remain. [SPEAKER_B]: So it's either George or Kelsey. [SPEAKER_C]: What did you do? Or Kelsey, you woke up and did what? [SPEAKER_B]: Prove it. [SPEAKER_C]: I will. And I robbed. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, you were a robber. [SPEAKER_B]: She obviously did not rob. Looking at the voice, we just have three people who we can't tell. You are a very bad liar. We can't tell. [SPEAKER_F]: He's like. [SPEAKER_E]: He's like oppressed. [SPEAKER_B]: But we can't tell who's. [SPEAKER_D]: A werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: I think werewolves. Werewolves. Minion. [SPEAKER_D]: Just say who you are. [SPEAKER_B]: Don't be confident for once in your life. [SPEAKER_E]: But the Tanner has an imperative. [SPEAKER_F]: I told you I was a werewolf, but I'm hoping I got robbed or troublemade. It's an interesting strategy. I think it backfired on me. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm voting for Kelsey. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm voting for Dylan. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you claim robber? But you were looking at the cards when you claimed robber. No, I was looking at your card. Okay, time is up."}

[SPEAKER_E]: I'm not lying. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm not lying. [SPEAKER_F]: Feasible to be. Couldn't lie. [SPEAKER_D]: Hook me up to a polygraph test. I'll pass. [SPEAKER_E]: We got time right here. [SPEAKER_C]: We're not allowed to say bombs club, but we're allowed out of the polygraph. [SPEAKER_B]: That's convenient what you do. [SPEAKER_C]: I was a lonely mason. [SPEAKER_E]: Again. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah, but there were two Masons. [SPEAKER_E]: I thought there were four. You woke up and said there were four of us. [SPEAKER_F]: Weren't you a Mason? [SPEAKER_E]: No. [SPEAKER_F]: You swapped a mason. [SPEAKER_B]: Me and Katie came up near you. Well that's convenient cuz I was a robbery. [SPEAKER_D]: You robbed me. [SPEAKER_B]: No, I robbed her. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, so you're back to normal? [SPEAKER_E]: Oh yeah. Awesome. So I'm still drunk. Well, I'm not drunk anymore. [SPEAKER_D]: So it sounds like Kelsey's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: What about Pete? [SPEAKER_F]: No, I'm not Minion. [SPEAKER_E]: Kelsey. What Was that face? [SPEAKER_D]: She's flirting. She's flirting. [SPEAKER_E]: Uh huh. [SPEAKER_B]: Can't use your wallet. [SPEAKER_G]: There's a bunch of liars here. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm not one of them. So you were troublemaker. [SPEAKER_G]: I was the troublemaker. You and you are now switched. [SPEAKER_D]: No, that's not Okay. I was the troubleshooter. I think she's playing Tanner or Minion right now. [SPEAKER_E]: Is she? [SPEAKER_D]: Because I was a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_G]: You're not. [SPEAKER_B]: But I was calling out a Tanner for being a Tanner. [SPEAKER_F]: Huh. [SPEAKER_E]: And you're a robber. You're like Mason. [SPEAKER_B]: What are you on Full house? Are you a Tanner? Is that. [SPEAKER_E]: I think there's too many cards that like, no one wants to claim. Like those types of cards. [SPEAKER_G]: Cards. [SPEAKER_D]: You know, like werewolves. [SPEAKER_E]: Like werewolves, Minion, Tanner. Like there's a lot of cards that no one wants to claim. [SPEAKER_D]: I wonder why. It's a game of bluffing. You claimed you troublemaker. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm wondering why everyone who claims to be a troublemaker claimed to have swapped me. [SPEAKER_D]: Because you're new. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, I'm fresh meat, aren't I? [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, and we have to. [SPEAKER_G]: Okay, so you robbed Katie. [SPEAKER_F]: What did. [SPEAKER_E]: What do you have now? [SPEAKER_B]: She was a drunk, okay? [SPEAKER_E]: Co Robert rated. [SPEAKER_C]: So now I'm the drunk. [SPEAKER_E]: So you could be something else. So wait, troublemaker goes. No, Robert goes first. Then. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, Robert goes first, Then troublemaker stole. [SPEAKER_E]: My drunk and then you. So now Dylan has the drunk. [SPEAKER_D]: I swapped you. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, yeah, whatever. So Kelsey, you swiped George. [SPEAKER_B]: Assume she's. She needs to be believed for a moment. [SPEAKER_E]: I am. That's why I'm believing her. [SPEAKER_B]: Then he would be the robber and. [SPEAKER_E]: No, he would be the drunk drunk. You robbed my drunk. [SPEAKER_B]: I robbed you. [SPEAKER_D]: And what about the drunk? [SPEAKER_B]: And you're a robber. [SPEAKER_E]: He. What about What? Yeah, what did you. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, what about you? I'm a minion, okay? I say that he's a werewolf for Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: So are Pete and Brett werewolves? [SPEAKER_D]: No, I'm a troublemaker and I swapped. [SPEAKER_E]: I think these two are werewolf. I don't know what you are, but I think you're a werewolf because you're being very fishy. [SPEAKER_G]: Okay, I don't know how I lied. I was a robber and I took Brett's card and he was a Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: And now I'm a Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: So you. Why would you do. [SPEAKER_B]: That's a complete 180 with only two minutes left. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, so wait, you weren't a robber either. [SPEAKER_B]: I was a robber the whole time. [SPEAKER_G]: I was lying because he wants us to pick him because he thinks he's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: But I'm not the Tanner. I legit was a. I think she's playing where she's playing harder into this werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm pretty sure she's lying. [SPEAKER_E]: She's put a lot of thought into this. [SPEAKER_C]: What about Pete? I'm pretty sure I'm a minion. [SPEAKER_D]: Wait, in what world would a Tanner Mason would a Tanner out her know? [SPEAKER_B]: Did you open your eyes when they. [SPEAKER_E]: Said. [SPEAKER_B]: When they said, open your eyes, minion? [SPEAKER_F]: There was only two werewolves. [SPEAKER_D]: Only two. [SPEAKER_B]: Only two. Okay, well, that narrows it down. So it's Brett and him. [SPEAKER_D]: It's got to be. [SPEAKER_B]: I think we have to definitely no, because. What are you saying? I would not lie about being a robber unless I was a werewolf, which. [SPEAKER_E]: Is what we're saying. [SPEAKER_B]: Why would you say something? My feelings are hurt. [SPEAKER_D]: I. Kelsey's story makes zero sense whatsoever. [SPEAKER_E]: Just because you claimed troublemaker? [SPEAKER_D]: No, because she claimed that she stole the Tanner. Why would a Tanner come out and say, hey, I'm Tanner? [SPEAKER_G]: Because I realized I wasn't gonna get picked, so I was like, whatever, I'm. [SPEAKER_E]: Gonna get a werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: You wanted to get picked? [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: The Tanner sounds like Katie and her werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: She's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_G]: I'm not me. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm a drunk. I think we have George and Brett. [SPEAKER_D]: The only person who backed your drunk store up was him, which you're now claiming that was never a robber. So it sounds like you're a werewolf too. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, no, he just guessed. Lucky. No, I said I was drunk before he said that he robbed my car. That's why. Yeah, said he was a robber. After I said that I was drunk, so he just jumped on. I'm going. Kelsey, we have to vote. I'm voting George. Dylan, are you on our team? Are you on the winning team? [SPEAKER_C]: I'm voting for Pete. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, hi. Sorry. [SPEAKER_D]: Time is up, everyone."}

[SPEAKER_A]: Somebody touched my card though. [SPEAKER_B]: I can tell. [SPEAKER_A]: It might have been me though. [SPEAKER_D]: The audience is probably, you know, you're. [SPEAKER_E]: Probably fidgeting with it. [SPEAKER_C]: So what were you? George and Dylan, now that you're swapped? [SPEAKER_E]: Kelsey, you said George and Kelsey. Strategy. [SPEAKER_C]: Now the truth has come out. [SPEAKER_E]: Which one is it? [SPEAKER_C]: I switched Dylan and George. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, so what were you? [SPEAKER_F]: I was a drunk. [SPEAKER_E]: And what were you? [SPEAKER_D]: I was a robber. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, what'd you rob? Did you rob him? [SPEAKER_D]: I touched his card. Oh, it's all up on that card. [SPEAKER_E]: You took it. [SPEAKER_A]: And what were you before that was a robber. I was a robber and you switched. [SPEAKER_D]: With me and I got your card. [SPEAKER_A]: What card did I get? [SPEAKER_E]: You have a robber now, apparently. What were you. [SPEAKER_C]: No, we want him to say. Oh, is cuz I was. [SPEAKER_A]: He knows what he. [SPEAKER_E]: All right. [SPEAKER_D]: Right. I saw he had a Mason card. He actually. [SPEAKER_A]: It's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, Werewolf card. [SPEAKER_A]: No, no, no. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, just. Just. Pete and I were Masons, so I. [SPEAKER_D]: Why are we celebrating? [SPEAKER_C]: I can back his story. I just didn't want. [SPEAKER_E]: Wait, you were in a trouble? [SPEAKER_D]: Why would you like. I would be a troublemaker if you were a Mason. Like just come to the game. [SPEAKER_F]: Mason's part. You got spicy. [SPEAKER_D]: He's a troublemaker. He's a troublemaker at heart. [SPEAKER_C]: I just didn't want us to Bark up the wrong tree with being like thinking he's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: So you guys were both Masons? [SPEAKER_C]: Yes. [SPEAKER_E]: Or you were both Mason? [SPEAKER_C]: They were Masons. [SPEAKER_D]: I robbed him. I'm a Mason now. [SPEAKER_C]: We're Mason, bro. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh my gosh. [SPEAKER_A]: I was a werewolf. You robbed me. [SPEAKER_B]: Right. [SPEAKER_A]: I was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Robbed you. You. [SPEAKER_C]: He's being a dockle Hoover. [SPEAKER_D]: What did you do? [SPEAKER_E]: I. So I actually was troublemaker. I was waiting for Brett to like. [SPEAKER_D]: Didn't have to wait long. [SPEAKER_E]: Did you actually said. Well, the thing is. Yeah, he kind of killed himself with the whole. [SPEAKER_A]: Oh, big time. There's only two left. Two werewolves right here. [SPEAKER_E]: All right, which card did you take? [SPEAKER_C]: One of them in the middle. [SPEAKER_E]: Which one? I mean, you were the drunk. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: That's funny. I was the drunk. [SPEAKER_F]: No, you weren't. [SPEAKER_E]: Which card did you take? You didn't wake up the same time I woke up. Troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: I think these three are on a team together. A werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Minion. The girls and Dylan. Sorry. The women in Dylan. [SPEAKER_A]: So what did you do if you were a troublemaker? [SPEAKER_D]: 2018. [SPEAKER_E]: I was a troublemaker, but I chose not to. Troublemaker. [SPEAKER_A]: So now I know. [SPEAKER_D]: You choose not to. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, sorry. [SPEAKER_E]: The drunk is the only one that has to do an action in this set. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, the Mason set. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, but they don't move any cards. [SPEAKER_C]: The drunk has to do their actions. [SPEAKER_F]: Did you really do. [SPEAKER_E]: I woke up and I drunk switched my card out. She drunk switched it out. [SPEAKER_A]: She forgot to hiccup when you're drunk. [SPEAKER_E]: She might be playing Tanner though. [SPEAKER_C]: She could be a werewolf who's playing minion. [SPEAKER_E]: Or she might be. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm going for Kelsey. You can't talk. [SPEAKER_E]: Why is Dylan not? [SPEAKER_C]: The look at his face. [SPEAKER_D]: Which one did you pick? [SPEAKER_C]: No, which card Kelsey picked? [SPEAKER_D]: Same one. [SPEAKER_E]: That one. [SPEAKER_D]: She said curious. [SPEAKER_A]: You're a fiber. Fight fight. [SPEAKER_D]: And you chose not to troublemake, which makes no sense. Which we're just not is convenient. [SPEAKER_A]: Actually, if I was a troublemaker, I wouldn't want to pick a werewolf and be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: The troublemaker switches to cards, but doesn't at that. [SPEAKER_A]: Oh, well, then I think you're lying. You're. [SPEAKER_E]: I just didn't want to confuse more people. [SPEAKER_A]: You got a vote. You just made a boat. [SPEAKER_D]: Kelsey's got my awfully convenient that cards didn't move around. [SPEAKER_A]: It is. I think so. [SPEAKER_C]: Kelsey, you just got my vote. [SPEAKER_E]: Sorry, Kelsey, I never. You never want to Dylan? [SPEAKER_D]: No, he's a good chance. [SPEAKER_A]: Dylan is a tan. [SPEAKER_C]: He's too dreamy. [SPEAKER_E]: Is he? [SPEAKER_F]: There's two Werewolves in the center there. These two right here. So the werewolves are in play. [SPEAKER_E]: No, werewolves are in play. So you're saying werewolves and you're saying you're a minion? [SPEAKER_F]: No, I'm a drunk. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, how do you know any cards then? Drunk doesn't look at anything. Aw, he doesn't know what he is anymore because he's a drunk. Yeah, but he didn't look at any middle cards either. [SPEAKER_D]: They can't both be drunk. [SPEAKER_E]: So now I want to vote for Dylan. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't know who to vote for, Dylan or Kelsey. [SPEAKER_A]: Don't vote for them. One of them or the Tanner. I'm not gonna vote for them. You're a werewolf. I'm not werewolf. One of them's a werewolf, and one of them's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_F]: What if I was the junk and I ended up becoming the Tanner? That'd be bad for you guys. [SPEAKER_C]: How long would you like to vote for? [SPEAKER_A]: 45 seconds. [SPEAKER_C]: George, what do you think? [SPEAKER_A]: Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: They got this little club going over here. The Masons over here control everything. My baby. I don't know about Brad. [SPEAKER_F]: Don't think they're werewolves? [SPEAKER_E]: No, I was dropping my gr. [SPEAKER_D]: You are a robber now you're a Tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: I can tell. So bad. [SPEAKER_B]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_C]: Werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: If there's no werewolves, the minion's a villager, though. [SPEAKER_C]: No, the minion has to get someone else to die in order to win. [SPEAKER_A]: Tanner. Werewolf. Werewolf. Werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: So much. [SPEAKER_F]: What were you saying you were, Brett? [SPEAKER_C]: What? [SPEAKER_F]: What were you saying you were? [SPEAKER_C]: I'm a Mason. I woke up with Pete in the beginning. [SPEAKER_E]: He said he. [SPEAKER_D]: Not the first time. [SPEAKER_C]: Kelsey. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm going to go for Kelsey. [SPEAKER_C]: I've had it.

Were you doppelganger? What's the point of the insomnia? Look at your card. If it was swift swapped. What if you're a werewolf now? Are you werewolf now? I was the hunter. Oh, you were the hunter. Are you not anymore? Well, I don't know. I didn't wake up and I didn't see anything different. Okay. Checks out. Yeah. What? Did you say something? No. Confess. And what'd you do? I'll give you a sweet 20 if you say that you're the werewolf. I was a troublemaker. A troublemade. Britt and Katie. Oh, what were you? I don't want to say. Dustin. Huh? Dustin. Werewolf. No. What? That's not good. No, I'm not confirmed. Let's vote. No, no, no. You're not confirmed. Let's vote. I have a bunch of information, but I feel weird. Say the information. Say all of the information right now. I was the seer. Confident. I was the seer. You always claim to be seer. I was the seer. I saw two werewolves in the middle. Really? Yes. Boom and boom. So we might have a tanner out there still trying to. Wouldn't it be cool if it was all it's a good werewolf, two werewolves and a tanner. It would be a perfect werewolf lie. Especially if nobody else was a seer. Especially if he was a doppelganger and saw two werewolves. Wake up? No, I'm just. I can confirm that Ed was the troublemaker because I robbed it. So I technically was the troublemaker. But then if you trouble made so now you're the trouble. You're a robber. You're the robber. Our game timer was off, so we. We'll just have to figure this out the old fashioned way. Nobody goes home. We can turn it on. I was like, there's no timer going. That's weird. Uh oh, hold on. You can't just choose, like, the timer mode, can you? Nice. Yeah, There you go. You can set a timer on your phone. Everybody be quiet. Yeah, we'll wait for it. When it gets down to like three minutes, we'll sit hippo now. Okay. Okay, that works. But I was the seer. I saw two werewolves in the middle. I just want to put that out there. So don't listen to a Tanner trying to F you guys up. It's true. What do you mean, you guys? We should be all. We're all guys. Okay. But we do have it. We might. I didn't see this car. It might be a Tanner. What are you? I was the insomniac. Are you still the insomniac? For real? That's a convenient. I was the insomniac. What were you now? The insomniac. That's funny because. I'm sorry. That's funny because. I'm the insomniac. They have the same story. Well, you can't prove it either. I don't know what to tell you. I'm the insomniac. Unless someone troublemate us. No. Okay, I vote for him. No. Cause he's probably the Tanner. Yeah, he's the Tanner. He wants us to vote. We gotta vote. To the right. But why would he pick the insomniac to. Liar. Maybe he's a doppelganger. And he is also an insomniac. But then he would have just said he was the doppelganger. Doppy gang. Not too the doppy. I'm doppy. Maybe you are the doppelganger. And you. I would have said that. I'm. I'm the insomniac. Well, I think we need to have a thumb war. That's how we battle things here at one night. Werewolf pause. The timer. Thumb wars all around. Who tries troublemade? I troublemaked. I trouble made Brad king. Which means she's now the seer and I'm now the troublemaker. Because she was the robber. All of our stories, and Dylan's the Tanner. So no. I guess we're either Dylan or Dustin. You said hunter. Yeah, I'm a hunter. You're. You're the hunter. Well, I guess mine makes sense. And ours Makes sense. So, okay, the the two of you have no story, Nobody's conflicted. But they have against hunter. Huh? Tanner D. Will the villager still win though? If a villager doesn't die? No, no. It would have to kill the hunter in the first place. Oh, you're right. Never mind. There's one minute left. So if you kill me, who should I vote for? No one. We have no werewolves. We don't want to kill you. This is our village is safe. Except for suicidal maniac. You guys are just believing that. No, I'm not. I don't believe anything. I believe these two. I don't believe I'm telling the truth. Uh huh. I think it's two werewolves and a doppelganger. That's what it feels like. Three werewolves. Werewolf boys would pull this. 30 seconds. It feels like this half of the table is where. I don't know how much I got stressed for you. Yeah, I think it's Brett, Dylan and Dustin. But that would have to be such a. I think it's Katie. Kelsey. That would have to be such a bold plan for me to call Cyr out. Yeah, it is. It is. But it works because no one else plays. Because I'm the seer. There's two werewolves in the middle. All right, but we got five seconds. Five, four, Vote to the right. Don't vote for. That's something we're open to say. Vote to the right. Time is up. Do not vote."}

[SPEAKER_C]: I was not the doppelganger. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I mean, we're trying to go. What? [SPEAKER_C]: Wait, but if there wasn't a doppel, what were you to start off with? [SPEAKER_B]: I was a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: And what were you to start off with? [SPEAKER_B]: I was. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, well, if I did claim seer. [SPEAKER_B]: I said that Brett was a troublemaker, and he agreed that he was a troublemaker. So why are you lying? [SPEAKER_C]: Kelsey. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm not lying. [SPEAKER_C]: But he ended up as a doppelganger. [SPEAKER_B]: Now, how did you get a doppelganger? Doppelganger. And now there'd be two werewolves. And now he's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Am I a werewolf? [SPEAKER_B]: Dude, tell me. Yeah, you're a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Because I was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Wait, would a doppelganger. Werewolf.

[SPEAKER_B]: These two were werewolves. [SPEAKER_E]: And no. [SPEAKER_D]: I woke up, there was zero werewolves, and he troublemaked me. [SPEAKER_B]: Brody cool is. [SPEAKER_E]: But I'm not Brody. [SPEAKER_B]: We're recording a video. It's episode 100. It's game 100, and you're ruining it. [SPEAKER_E]: Monkeys, man, say sorry for being so. [SPEAKER_D]: You switched. You trouble made. [SPEAKER_C]: I thought. [SPEAKER_D]: Did someone play Wrong? [SPEAKER_C]: Did someone. [SPEAKER_B]: Someone's lying because someone's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: No, someone is not a Tanner. Someone's a doppelganger. [SPEAKER_B]: So you doppelganger Werewolf? [SPEAKER_C]: No, I didn't say that. Oh, my God. Okay, resistance is futile. [SPEAKER_D]: Don't use the dog as a stunning. [SPEAKER_B]: Guys, we didn't figure out what happened. I trust he was a seer because I was a troublemaker. Yeah, everyone else I don't know about. [SPEAKER_C]: I doppelgang seer, so I got to see two cards in the middle. [SPEAKER_E]: And what'd you see in the middle? [SPEAKER_B]: Both werewolves. [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_B]: No. [SPEAKER_C]: So now Justin's a werewolf? Is that what you're saying? But why are you saying but he. [SPEAKER_B]: Has a dumpel gator card? [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I mean, I guess. Vote for me. I don't know. [SPEAKER_C]: Keith Tanner. He's obviously a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: Whoever robbed her troublemate needs to get this story straight. [SPEAKER_B]: I troublemate Dylan and Dustin. That's all I did. [SPEAKER_C]: One minute I heard him get the doppelganger card. [SPEAKER_D]: Who was the robber? Anyone rob? [SPEAKER_B]: I did not rob. I saw. Sounds like robbers in the middle along. [SPEAKER_C]: With the two werewolves. [SPEAKER_B]: What did you do? [SPEAKER_E]: No. [SPEAKER_D]: What did you do? No. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, I didn't do anything. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, at first you were the seer, and now you didn't do anything? [SPEAKER_C]: Cause you caught me. I was supposed to be you. [SPEAKER_B]: You a hunter or a tater? [SPEAKER_D]: I think it's safe bet just to win for Dustin. [SPEAKER_E]: I say safe bet. [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_A]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_E]: You want to be a jerk about it? [SPEAKER_D]: This is the game. [SPEAKER_E]: Don't vote for Katie. [SPEAKER_D]: Why? [SPEAKER_E]: Because you're Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: Fair enough. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, wait. Because you just said why? You're either Tanner or hunter. You. You want us to pick you? [SPEAKER_D]: I'm just saying, I was. I woke up alone. And if he troublemad mean Dustin, that's where the werewolf ended up. [SPEAKER_B]: Careful, Brady. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, this is a tactic, man. [SPEAKER_B]: Why are we voting for Kelsey? That's what I'm saying. [SPEAKER_C]: Because she's the robber. I was the robber. I stole her. Tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: Time is up, everyone. [SPEAKER_D]: Three."}

Because I was the werewolf and there was only one. [SPEAKER_A]: I was the werewolf. And I can tell you because I get to look at a card from the center and I saw the tanner in the center. So we do not have a tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: Did you also look at the center? Which card did you look at? [SPEAKER_C]: I looked at this card or that card. I forgot. [SPEAKER_D]: And which one did you see? What did you see? [SPEAKER_C]: The robber. [SPEAKER_D]: So is anyone else the robber? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Are you a pirate now? [SPEAKER_E]: No, I was the drunk. [SPEAKER_D]: So you drunk yourself. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, I did. [SPEAKER_C]: Right here. [SPEAKER_D]: It's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: What did you drink from? [SPEAKER_E]: From this. What do you mean? From the sun. [SPEAKER_D]: Which one do you think? Because it could be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Because it could be a werewolf. And we had a. You know what? I'm a werewolf now. [SPEAKER_D]: How do you. But the drunk doesn't know. He doesn't look at his car. [SPEAKER_E]: I did that one. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm very suspicious. [SPEAKER_E]: I did a drunk swap with this. [SPEAKER_C]: I think he's a tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: But Brett. Well, then again, I don't trust Brett. Yeah. There you go. [SPEAKER_B]: Thank you. [SPEAKER_D]: I like to be able to see your eyes. [SPEAKER_E]: How can we believe he swapped mine. [SPEAKER_A]: In his card, Right? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: How can we believe we should vote for him? Cuz I was the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: But he was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: But, sir, you. [SPEAKER_C]: Pete. Pete, you're. [SPEAKER_A]: You're so good at lying. You never like, you never believe Your own lie. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: So Robber, I say we. I say we vote for beat. Because if. If you're saying you were the werewolf and you're saying that you did swap them. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Then there's no reason to vote because. [SPEAKER_B]: What? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, but he's saying. [SPEAKER_E]: No reason that he. But there's no reason that he. There's no way he would win by saying that he's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, unless I. [SPEAKER_E]: Because how else would he become a werewolf? Now, he couldn't have drunk himself into werewolf. Troublemaker was the last move before mine. [SPEAKER_C]: Ridge. [SPEAKER_E]: Sorry, Pete. [SPEAKER_D]: I think dad was the werewolf and. [SPEAKER_A]: No, he only said he was after I said he got the werewolf card. [SPEAKER_C]: And he said you were a liar. All right, don't be played. [SPEAKER_A]: Don't be played by Pete. [SPEAKER_D]: Pete the werewolf. Pete the pirate werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Leave your husband. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm supposed to kill. [SPEAKER_A]: In the lore, we're just three kids and an adult. [SPEAKER_C]: You're going to kill an innocent, innocent villager? [SPEAKER_E]: An innocent old man? [SPEAKER_D]: Well, I guess. I mean, yeah, we'll suffer. Dustin, what do you think? [SPEAKER_E]: I mean, I don't see a reason why. I don't see a reason why he would want us to vote for him. There's no. If you swap their cards, then he. Why would he lie? [SPEAKER_C]: Because he knew I got what he was and he is now the werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: But I. Before we even said that I knew. [SPEAKER_C]: But before you came out the information. [SPEAKER_E]: I said he was a werewolf first. [SPEAKER_A]: I added you. [SPEAKER_C]: You outed me first. That's right. [SPEAKER_D]: I also feel like Brett's not being extremely convincing. Like he just keeps saying the same thing. [SPEAKER_A]: What do you want me to say? I don't have any other information. [SPEAKER_D]: I thought it was actually true. You'd be like, think about the stats, Katie. I know you like to win. [SPEAKER_A]: Think about the stats. [SPEAKER_C]: Don't let your husband do this too. [SPEAKER_A]: But I feel like in our practice game when I did that you all. Everyone voted for me, so. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: So now. [SPEAKER_E]: But you were lying in the practice. [SPEAKER_C]: Shush. [SPEAKER_D]: That's true. [SPEAKER_C]: And he's lying. [SPEAKER_B]: We saw through it. [SPEAKER_D]: Then you were. [SPEAKER_E]: But now there's no reason why you would lie. [SPEAKER_A]: But I also have nothing else to say because I don't know what to. [SPEAKER_D]: Say other than you're smiling. I don't believe you anymore. [SPEAKER_C]: Hit the clock, Katie. [SPEAKER_A]: But you did troublemake me and Pete, right. [SPEAKER_B]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_D]: Sorry. [SPEAKER_A]: Unless. I mean, Katie could be wolfing us. [SPEAKER_E]: Too, but she could also be wolfing. [SPEAKER_D]: I was. I'm not wolfing you. I was the troublemaker. And I troublemade the two of you. Wind that finger up, baby. [SPEAKER_A]: You don't have anything to plug while we walk. [SPEAKER_D]: Wind it up. Check out my Twitter. [SPEAKER_E]: Hey. [SPEAKER_D]: Actually, don't.

[SPEAKER_B]: So this is the Tanner. This is a werewolf. And this is a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: And we circle. I don't know what this is, but these were werewolves.

[SPEAKER_E]: The drunk should always go first, because that happened last round, too. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: So we should vote for Katie drunk. [SPEAKER_E]: We should vote for Brett. He wasn't even the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: I was drunk. I don't know what that card was. But you didn't see it. [SPEAKER_E]: What were you were. You the robber? So Brett got lucky. [SPEAKER_C]: No, I didn't get lucky. I looked at his card. Because he's a wild card, and I want to know what he was before he can go around being my kind. [SPEAKER_D]: Wait, then if you were the seer, then you're lying about being a seer. [SPEAKER_E]: But why would you believe him? [SPEAKER_C]: She's either Tanner, because he just said. [SPEAKER_D]: That he's the robber. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, or he could be playing us. [SPEAKER_C]: Either you're werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: I saw a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Here you are so much lying. You don't. [SPEAKER_E]: Were you a werewolf? [SPEAKER_B]: You don't get lucky and see two werewolves. [SPEAKER_E]: Dustin did last round. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, that's Dustin. [SPEAKER_C]: Dylan. [SPEAKER_B]: Excuse me. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to call it, but Katie. [SPEAKER_E]: Never gets old. Never gets old. [SPEAKER_C]: Who did you rob? [SPEAKER_B]: Ben Franklin. [SPEAKER_C]: So, Katie sounded like he took whatever. [SPEAKER_B]: Your card was because your card was. Why would I rob anybody? [SPEAKER_C]: It was either I get a chance. [SPEAKER_B]: Of being a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: What? What does that mean? [SPEAKER_E]: He's, like, gonna play it safe. He's saying if he robs, he could. [SPEAKER_C]: Turn into a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Dustin's very frustrated. [SPEAKER_C]: We're being electrocuted. [SPEAKER_E]: Blood brothers. [SPEAKER_C]: Blood brothers. Oh, I grabbed a sword. [SPEAKER_E]: It's not electric. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, you get electric. [SPEAKER_E]: It's electric. [SPEAKER_C]: So, Katie, what were you. Because Pete is probably now that card. [SPEAKER_E]: Did you rob me, Robert? He won't say. [SPEAKER_C]: Because you were bad. [SPEAKER_B]: Why would I rob somebody? [SPEAKER_E]: I don't know. [SPEAKER_B]: I can tell you. [SPEAKER_D]: What if she was the Tanner? [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, someone's at the front door. All right, bro. [SPEAKER_C]: Trick or treat. [SPEAKER_D]: They can watch us play. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, hi. [SPEAKER_B]: It's the werewolf.

[SPEAKER_C]: Now that's what we should vote for. Katie, what were you. [SPEAKER_E]: I was a seer. [SPEAKER_B]: She is so much a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: No, you don't have your card anymore. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, cool. I don't believe that he robbed anybody because he wasn't the robber. [SPEAKER_C]: He was the robber. [SPEAKER_E]: No, he might have been the robber, but I don't believe that he was the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, now he's not the robber. [SPEAKER_B]: Let's find out. [SPEAKER_A]: One, two. [SPEAKER_E]: Did you swap cards with anyone? [SPEAKER_B]: Why would I swap cards with a werewolf, of all things? Like you are. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm not aware. [SPEAKER_B]: Yes, you are. Yes, you are. Yes, you are. You are, too. [SPEAKER_D]: See, the thing is, when he robbed, he knows who the card is so. [SPEAKER_C]: He won't say that he robbed it. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, because he knows it's probably. [SPEAKER_C]: It's either Tanner or wolf. [SPEAKER_D]: What do you think that's true? I. I don't know. Remaining the way she was lying like a monster. [SPEAKER_B]: It had to be chance of werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: So who do we vote for? [SPEAKER_D]: You vote for me. It's a voting d. It sounds like. [SPEAKER_C]: You were a drunk and you might. [SPEAKER_D]: Have took I might have. [SPEAKER_C]: Katie, what were you prove yourself. [SPEAKER_E]: How's this here? [SPEAKER_C]: I'm over Katie, but she probably has. [SPEAKER_D]: The wrong okay, then should we vote. [SPEAKER_B]: For being Just don't vote for the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: Did it help that it's a werewolf instead of a Tanner? [SPEAKER_E]: Did you say don't vote for the Tanner? [SPEAKER_B]: You're the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: That's a good Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: No, I know you're a werewolf. It's just like whatever your card was. [SPEAKER_E]: I was a seer. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, losing the game for yourself. [SPEAKER_D]: Your stats are dropping. [SPEAKER_C]: Your stats are dropped. Look at them go. [SPEAKER_E]: All right, it was a Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: So we need to vote for. [SPEAKER_D]: Vote to the right. [SPEAKER_C]: Then we're back in the same situation. [SPEAKER_D]: Vote to the right. [SPEAKER_E]: He's going to vote to the left. [SPEAKER_D]: It won't matter.

[SPEAKER_A]: Being a CEO makes me hungry for some nerd rope. [SPEAKER_C]: What she eating there, boss? [SPEAKER_A]: This is. I'm on a diet. My wife put me on this diet. Yeah, I don't like them, but I'll eat them. I'll eat it. [SPEAKER_C]: You can only eat really thin Twizzler, like, things covered in sugary candy. Nailed it. [SPEAKER_A]: Nailed it. What did you do last night? [SPEAKER_C]: So I just took a little snooze fast, and then I woke up. And I might have taken something that didn't belong to me. But you know what? I. I earned it. Because I've worked here the longest. By tarnation. [SPEAKER_D]: When did we become my tarnation? [SPEAKER_C]: My tarnation. I earned it. [SPEAKER_E]: What you do last night? [SPEAKER_A]: I did nothing. But you know me in my drinking habits, so I might have. I might have sleepwalked and exchanged something from the center. [SPEAKER_C]: From the center? [SPEAKER_A]: From the center. [SPEAKER_C]: You also slithered. [SPEAKER_A]: I was drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: Interesting. [SPEAKER_A]: Maybe a CEO, but I have my flaws. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, yeah, you're just alcoholic. That's fine. [SPEAKER_A]: I'm on my diet. My diet's getting okay. What'd you do last night? [SPEAKER_E]: Well, I woke up. It's interesting you say that. Cause I woke up and I also exchanged a card from the center. [SPEAKER_C]: Interesting. So we have two people claiming to be drunk. [SPEAKER_A]: Drunk. Ryan, what'd you do? [SPEAKER_D]: Say it loud. Say it proud. I'm a drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: What? [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, that's fun. [SPEAKER_C]: This is a great company. You're all a bunch of alcoholics. [SPEAKER_E]: All bunch of alcoholics. [SPEAKER_D]: Like I said, I really need this win, guys. But, yeah, I exchanged my card from the. With a card from the center. [SPEAKER_C]: Interesting. [SPEAKER_A]: Three drunks. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. All right. [SPEAKER_D]: Production is very low. [SPEAKER_A]: So you stole a card. [SPEAKER_C]: I did steal a card. And my card that I stole was not a drunk card. So who'd you steal from? I'll disclose that information at a later time, but I will say the person that I stole from, I don't know why they're claiming to be a drunk right now because. Because their card isn't dangerous at all or anything. [SPEAKER_A]: Someone doesn't have a dangerous card. Huh? Who's got a safety card out there? [SPEAKER_E]: Aha. [SPEAKER_A]: No, my card was so dangerous. No way she would say that about. [SPEAKER_C]: Either your drunk dangerous card, your drunk dangerous drunk card. [SPEAKER_A]: No, my real card was pretty dangerous. [SPEAKER_C]: What was your real card? [SPEAKER_A]: I don't want to get in. [SPEAKER_B]: What was your real card? [SPEAKER_A]: I don't want to. [SPEAKER_E]: Tell us. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't want to get. [SPEAKER_C]: Tell us or you get the tongue. [SPEAKER_E]: He's actually. He's the actual werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: He is pretty hairy. [SPEAKER_A]: I was the robber and I took his drunk. That's why I said I was drunk. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, how were you the robber? [SPEAKER_E]: She just said that she. [SPEAKER_A]: Cause you're the liar. [SPEAKER_C]: But you also claim to be drunk, so. [SPEAKER_A]: Cause I became a drunk at the end. [SPEAKER_C]: You don't get to know that a robbery. [SPEAKER_B]: I do. [SPEAKER_C]: No, but you claim drunk. [SPEAKER_A]: No, because I ended up as the drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: No, but that wasn't your story. You said you woke up to see. [SPEAKER_A]: If someone came out with it. [SPEAKER_C]: Uh huh. So you've already been caught in a lie. Yeah, keep eating, nerds. [SPEAKER_A]: Alright, vote for me then. [SPEAKER_C]: Maybe I will. [SPEAKER_E]: So Brett, what if I tell you that I was actually the troublemaker? It's your card. It's somebody else's card. [SPEAKER_A]: It depends if you get it. Depends if she gave it back to me or not. [SPEAKER_C]: How would I give it back to you? [SPEAKER_A]: But you're the robber. [SPEAKER_E]: You just said that you were the robber. Either way, I go after the robbery. [SPEAKER_A]: No, she could have robbed me and then you could give my car right back to me. So who to trouble me. [SPEAKER_C]: So what were you? Were you the drunk? [SPEAKER_D]: I was the drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: Sounds like we don't have any. Wear a hole. [SPEAKER_B]: One minute. [SPEAKER_C]: Real and eventful. [SPEAKER_A]: I think it may be in our interest to vote for Ryan if your story isn't true. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, were you the werewolf in the beginning? [SPEAKER_A]: Yes, I was the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, is it? [SPEAKER_A]: Sorry, not true. [SPEAKER_C]: So Katie, switch. [SPEAKER_A]: Wait, wait, hold up. Darry. Not true. [SPEAKER_C]: So I was not the robber. So Brett still works you tanning? Am I tanning? Am I tanning? [SPEAKER_A]: No, he said he was a troublemaker. He's saying he swapped me and Ryan. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, but I plan. [SPEAKER_B]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_E]: Wait, so you were really a werewolf? Well, then I gave Katie a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: What were you in the beginning? [SPEAKER_C]: Tanner. So don't vote for Brad. [SPEAKER_A]: This is too funny. We can't vote for Katie either because I wasn't the werewolf? [SPEAKER_C]: What were you? [SPEAKER_E]: I'm not saying. [SPEAKER_C]: Were you the minion? [SPEAKER_A]: No. We gotta vote for Ryan. If we want to win, we gotta vote for Ryan. [SPEAKER_C]: Why would we vote for Ryan? [SPEAKER_A]: Do you want to win? [SPEAKER_C]: Ryan's a drunk, Tyler."}

[SPEAKER_A]: I robbed Ryan. He was the drunk. [SPEAKER_C]: You're the drunk again. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I was the robber. [SPEAKER_C]: Were you lying? [SPEAKER_A]: He's lying. [SPEAKER_D]: And Brett was the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: Interesting. So you're the troublemaker now. [SPEAKER_D]: Unless somebody. [SPEAKER_C]: Because the robber does go first. So did you trouble make. [SPEAKER_A]: I troublemaked people at this table. But you see me claiming his car. Got it out so quick. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, that was beautiful. Beautiful. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm just gonna. Let me say that was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Interesting strategy. [SPEAKER_E]: Somebody promptly switched my car. [SPEAKER_C]: Or they didn't. [SPEAKER_A]: He's looking at me. Yeah, I switched Katie and Ryan. [SPEAKER_C]: Who are you? There's a card. [SPEAKER_A]: Tanner, that was a card. So now you must be a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: Right. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, so we should vote for Ryan because I was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: That he was a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: We're all wolves together. So you can either vote for him or you can definitely vote for Ryan. Because I'm saying I was. And if you swapped our cards, then. [SPEAKER_A]: I swapped both of you. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, cool. So we're both just hanging out, chilling. You just love to cause chaos. [SPEAKER_A]: But I don't know what you're doing, though. So you are. [SPEAKER_C]: What am I doing? [SPEAKER_A]: And you're a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, am I? You can play that game. [SPEAKER_A]: But I did swap your cards. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. [SPEAKER_E]: You swap Hawk. Yeah, she wolf's the case. She's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Why am I going for you? Because you gave her my werewolf clothes. But she said she was a wolf too. [SPEAKER_E]: You hopefully have. [SPEAKER_C]: Interesting. [SPEAKER_A]: One of you is a minion, and I just can't figure out. [SPEAKER_C]: Are we? [SPEAKER_A]: Unless you're both Tanners. What do you mean? [SPEAKER_C]: Both of us can't be Tanners? There's only one Tanner card. Both of us can't be minions. There's only one minion card. [SPEAKER_A]: So what are you saying? One of you is a minion? One of you is a Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: I was a robber. [SPEAKER_E]: You were a robber. [SPEAKER_A]: He took my troublemaker. He confirmed my troublemaker who do we. [SPEAKER_D]: So now you're confirming your troublemaker. [SPEAKER_A]: I mean, I was. You saw it. You stole my card. There's no way for me to get troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: So now he is the Robert card, though. [SPEAKER_D]: What am I? [SPEAKER_C]: You're the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_A]: Oh, I'm assuming you called me out before I said it. Unless that was a really good why. Yeah, no, you called me out on that troublemaker. The thing is, we're on the same team here. We're on the same village team. We need to figure out which one of ding dongs to vote for, because either one of them. Either they're both werewolves or one of them's a minion. We don't want to vote for the minion. We don't want to vote for the Tanner either. But they're not letting up. I'm assuming they're. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, a minute and a half. [SPEAKER_E]: So what did you do? [SPEAKER_A]: I switched YouTube. [SPEAKER_C]: And how did you feel about that? [SPEAKER_A]: Good at the time, but bad now. I don't want to mess with him. He's so new to the arts and expert at the game. I don't want to mess with the expert. [SPEAKER_C]: Bigger fish to fry. Interesting. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, this is interesting. [SPEAKER_A]: If you guys want to say anything. Ryan, who should we vote for? [SPEAKER_B]: 1 minute remaining. [SPEAKER_A]: She came right out of the gate, said he was the werewolf, but I think he heard me. Trouble. Because I didn't. I didn't make a little scratch noise. [SPEAKER_E]: No, there's a blanket there for a reason. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, I accidentally, like, I got. I got like that. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, no, I didn't hear. Actually. I almost fell asleep while I was laying there. [SPEAKER_A]: Almost forgot that he came right out of the game. Said he was a whirlf. Makes me thinks he's a minion. So now maybe the minions over here, but maybe. I don't know. I guess we vote for DeAndre. They're just going to vote. I don't know who they're voting for. [SPEAKER_B]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_A]: Doesn't matter. It's gonna be tied. It's most likely gonna be tied. They're gonna team up on someone. We need a team up on one of them. [SPEAKER_D]: All right, who do you want to go with? [SPEAKER_A]: I don't know. I guess DeAndre. [SPEAKER_D]: DeAndre. All right, 10 seconds. [SPEAKER_C]: Wait. [SPEAKER_E]: Why don't we not vote for Katie? Because we know that she's a world. [SPEAKER_A]: You had five minutes to tell us why we should vote for kids, Katie. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, I said I was aware from you say you probably made both of us. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, but then she said she was aware of."}

Nothing can stop us. [SPEAKER_D]: No, we got this. [SPEAKER_A]: I want to know what DeAndre did and I want to know now. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, throw it down. What'd you do? DeAndre, that's a drunk. Oh man. Again. [SPEAKER_C]: Again. [SPEAKER_A]: He's lying. [SPEAKER_D]: Is he? Is he now? Well, Ryan, what did you do as the troublemaker? [SPEAKER_A]: She got him out. [SPEAKER_C]: So I'm guessing you were a robber then. Yes, you're right. I swapped yours in Brett's cards. [SPEAKER_D]: So Brett, I want to know what you were. [SPEAKER_C]: Might not want to know. [SPEAKER_D]: What part of this don't you understand? [SPEAKER_C]: You may not want to know. [SPEAKER_D]: There's no way you could be a werewolf again. You've been a werewolf like three times. [SPEAKER_A]: I may not have been a werewolf, but it doesn't mean I didn't want want the werewolf team not to win. [SPEAKER_D]: So Minion, I'm not. [SPEAKER_A]: I played the fifth on that. But what were you? You were a robber. So now I'm the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: Look at me. I am the robber. [SPEAKER_A]: So DeAndre's just claiming drunk over here. [SPEAKER_C]: A little baby. [SPEAKER_D]: He's so sad. I don't know if I've ever held him like this book of this is like the most maternal feeling ever. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay, so what really happened? [SPEAKER_D]: I was the robber and I sold. [SPEAKER_A]: His troublemaker any troublemaker in here. So we shouldn't vote for her or the world's win cuz she mining over there. I'm what over here the question is do we vote for him? Because he's claiming drunk but he might have been the world but if he was a drunk thing he's drunk into. [SPEAKER_D]: His little yellow guys banana like that type of menu gr. [SPEAKER_A]: So what's going. [SPEAKER_C]: That's. That's what we believe that Bren is actually the minion. Cuz he might actually Been Tanner. In which case he still doesn't want her festival for her because she didn't have the T. Sorry. She would. [SPEAKER_A]: Didn't have the T. So we shouldn't vote for Katie. Cuz if she was the werewolf, I would have called her out immediately. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I guess that's right. Yeah, I guess that's the reason why you keep Tanner and me in the game. [SPEAKER_A]: Because either way, the question is, what did you do, DeAndre? Were you wolfing or were you actually drunken? [SPEAKER_D]: Drunken wolfing. Interesting. [SPEAKER_C]: We're not doing this again. We're not doing it. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. Wait, what happened? [SPEAKER_A]: I have a confession. [SPEAKER_D]: Of course you do. [SPEAKER_A]: I was. I don't know if I trust Ryan. Ryan, did you swap us Katie and I? You mean real here? You mean full real? [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, do we ever tell him that like most of the cards you don't have to do the action? Because like the app says, you may swap two cards. As the troublemaker, you didn't actually have to swap two. [SPEAKER_A]: But he swapped Katie and I. I was the Tanner. So we don't want to vote for Katie. Now here's the thing. That means DeAndre could be the minion. No. So we should. We should vote. If you're telling the truth, me and you should vote for DeAndre. Sounds like it's when. Unless he's a villager, then we're gonna lose. But it seems like we're gonna lose anyway if he has a villager. Because if he's a minion, then he wants one of us to die. Which, I don't know, doesn't sound like it's gonna happen. So we should vote for DeAndre again. [SPEAKER_C]: That's if he actually switched both of you. [SPEAKER_B]: One minute remain. [SPEAKER_D]: True. I feel like he wouldn't be lying. [SPEAKER_A]: If not, then he would want to work with you to vote for him. So either way, you want to vote for him, so. Yes. [SPEAKER_C]: That means you have the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_A]: Right? [SPEAKER_C]: And she should have the Tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. So we don't want to vote for it because only I should have the robber. Then he has mystery card. [SPEAKER_C]: Mystery card. [SPEAKER_A]: Which it's either minion or werewolf or. [SPEAKER_D]: Or drunk. [SPEAKER_A]: No. Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Only 30 seconds left. [SPEAKER_A]: I guess we should vote for him. Cuz I can't think of what else he would be other than a werewolf or a minion. Cuz if he was. If he was a drunk, then it's obviously out. I don't know what happened. State your case. I think we caught you. [SPEAKER_C]: I already said what I was. [SPEAKER_A]: You said you were the drunk and then that means werewolf and minion were the only cards in the middle. Katie, do you care at all? [SPEAKER_D]: I don't care. This is heaven on earth."}

[SPEAKER_B]: I'm not. [SPEAKER_E]: He's sitting there like he's distancing himself. [SPEAKER_A]: From his card as much as possible. [SPEAKER_F]: Sleep. I was a villager. [SPEAKER_E]: You were a villager. [SPEAKER_A]: So was I. [SPEAKER_F]: Mean and simple. [SPEAKER_D]: Who's the seer? [SPEAKER_F]: But there might not be one. [SPEAKER_E]: It might not be a seer. [SPEAKER_A]: It might be in the middle. Nobody's copying to it. [SPEAKER_E]: Anybody troublemaking or robbing? [SPEAKER_C]: I was a robber. I switched with Eric. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, guys, if Shane is truthful in what he just said, this game's over. Because I'm no longer a werewolf. I'm a person. I know he's a werewolf. I know I'm the only one. It's gonna be great, so let's just finish this real quick. You switch with me. [SPEAKER_A]: Yes. [SPEAKER_F]: So now you could be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: If you switch with me, you are a werewolf. And you are the only werewolf. And we should kill Shane. [SPEAKER_F]: And I think you fucked it, Shane. Because I believe Eric. [SPEAKER_E]: Dammit. [SPEAKER_F]: That's why you might not want to be. [SPEAKER_A]: Or he's looking completely truthful. He's looking for this opportunity. Him and Eren might both be werewolves, and he's protecting Aaron. [SPEAKER_D]: Eric, you mean? [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_F]: And Aaron. [SPEAKER_E]: I have no affiliations or ties to this man. [SPEAKER_A]: He was reveling in Eric's plan. [SPEAKER_E]: I mean, that's good. But the thing, though, is, like, I. [SPEAKER_F]: Believe Eric because I know how frustrated Shane will be, and I want to see that happen. [SPEAKER_D]: If what Shane said is true, and I was the werewolf, I looked at that card because no one else was a friend of mine. [SPEAKER_E]: So Calvin. [SPEAKER_D]: And that was a villager. And if Shane is truthful in that he took my card and switched our cards. [SPEAKER_A]: I did. [SPEAKER_D]: He's now a werewolf and he will be happy to die. [SPEAKER_C]: I can't take it back. I was. [SPEAKER_E]: I was a robbery. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't like this. [SPEAKER_E]: I mean, so in this scenario, then Eric now is the robber. Then Shane is the werewolf. Calvin is a villager, and Rick is a villager. [SPEAKER_F]: Villager. [SPEAKER_A]: Everybody seems to be good except Shane swapped with Eric. Now there's doubt there. [SPEAKER_C]: Who. [SPEAKER_A]: Who's what and what's who? I think I'm gonna trust Eric this late in the game, telling him, telling everyone that he was a werewolf. And now Shane is a werewolf. That's good, right? If we kill him, then everything's good. Shane should have looked at his card. [SPEAKER_E]: I know Rick is a villager because I was a seer and I looked at Rick to know if I could trust this man. Things seem to be okay. [SPEAKER_D]: I think we should all just hang Shane and kill Shane. [SPEAKER_E]: I'll hang Shane. Well, this is quick. Shane's a werewolf. Hang on. [SPEAKER_D]: Vote. Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: Shane is gonna die. [SPEAKER_C]: I played my hand too early. I let Eric know that. I let everyone know that I switched with Eric. Eric happened to me, the werewolf. So now once again, I'm the werewolf. That's okay, because I want to die."}

Everyone, reach out and touch the wood. All right. Everybody does. Anyone who wants to talk first? You do. I'm one of these. Oh, hey, me also. I'm not one. I know information. I'll say that much.

I know very little. He's not both. Are you saying you're a villager? I've said enough for now. Right. Wait for people to stop talking, start talking vaguely about what they know. Was anyone actually insomniac? You don't have to reveal if you woke up as a werewolf, but woke. If you didn't wake up as the assignment would be good information. I definitely woke up. So you're saying you're the insomnia. Can I. Can we hear something from you guys? I'm just trying to figure out information right now. I have information as well. Yeah. But I'm very concerned I might have information based on. What if someone else did? No, we need to hear. All right, I will say this. I was the seer. Yeah. And I know there's a werewolf at the table. Oh, because you looked at two cards and didn't see or. I saw somebody here. Yeah. And I'm keeping my mouth shut because I think there's a robber who's a little bit cheeky right now hiding underneath a werewolf. Hiding under a werewolf. Well, you would have stole the werewolf. Okay. Was there a troublemaker out there? I was not a troublemaker. Okay, no troublemakers. We haven't heard anything from these two. Fine. I was a troublemaker. Okay, so there was. I did switch cards. Who do you switch? I'm not gonna tell you that yet. Can you tell one of the people? Say one of them. I will tell you. I did not switch, Mike. Okay, that's great. That's. That's great to start. That's good, Mike. Give us some information. You've given us nothing. Yeah. Or at least can't give you anything. Okay. I don't believe that, though. Why? I don't know. Eric, what were you. I was not this. Oh, my. Were you the robber? So you wasn't the insomniac, the robber or the werewolf? Would you say you're the robber? I was the robber. You were the robber. Did you steal from anybody? I did. Okay. Who did you not steal from? No. Yeah. No. Here's the thing. Without saying that, is there anyone here that you can confirm or say that they are lying? No. No. What? You can't confirm or say they're lying? Well, okay, I can confirm that someone was telling the truth. Okay, that's great. Yeah. Who's telling the truth? Yeah. Who? We have a minute 15. Yeah. You're allowing the truth? You're allowed to say, let me. He was telling the truth and you were the robber? Yes. And you can confirm this? Who'd you look at? I looked in the center and I saw the troublemaker. Interesting. I saw the troublemaker and a villager. I think we might have two werewolves. One minute remaining. Well, I am a villager. I think we have one werewolf. You think it's Justin? Yeah. No, no, I think it's 100% true. And that's a troublemaker. No, no, they were. They were quick to confirm their story, and you guys are just. Yeah, I've been talking the whole time. The first thing I said was, I have no information if you were the Trollmaker because you guys were both werewolves. I was throwing out everything I knew since the beginning. I wasn't hesitating or waiting for anyone. 33 seconds, Eric. Only 30 seconds left. And after you robbed. I think it's those two. No, I think it's you two. I think we kill Paul. I think he's our best bet. Okay, fuck that. Should we vote? Yeah. What? I was not ready. We are not voting out 18."}

Robber, wake up. You may exchange your card with another player's card and then view your new card. Robber, close your eyes. Troublemaker, wake up. You may exchange cards between two other players.

[SPEAKER_D]: Had him on fast, even just like one second. [SPEAKER_A]: All right, I think they're on two right now. Two seconds. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, okay then. [SPEAKER_C]: Guys, I'm just gonna be perfectly legit. I was the insomniac. Woke up as the insomniac. [SPEAKER_E]: That's sad. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm gonna open my yogurt now. Have fun. [SPEAKER_F]: Okay, this time I was a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: Nice. You didn't switch me. I can confirm that. [SPEAKER_E]: That's fair. [SPEAKER_F]: Fair. [SPEAKER_E]: Any other comments to be made at the table? I didn't switch. [SPEAKER_A]: Not currently. [SPEAKER_D]: Who else did you not switch? [SPEAKER_F]: I didn't switch you. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, so you switched those two. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. Oh. [SPEAKER_A]: Or he didn't switch at all. Or he didn't switch at all. Or he didn't switch at all. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. [SPEAKER_E]: What do you have to say for yourself? I'm curious. [SPEAKER_A]: What do I have to say for yourself? I'd like to hear. Can you confirm that we switched? [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah, you did. [SPEAKER_A]: He's the werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, then I'm gonna. What are you and what do you. [SPEAKER_A]: Say your role is? Well, I was the werewolf. And if he switched us, more than. [SPEAKER_D]: Once Paul has lied about. [SPEAKER_A]: I know, I know. I'm going out on the limb. I was the werewolf. Okay. [SPEAKER_F]: No, and I. I went last. Except for you. But you didn't. [SPEAKER_A]: Unless there was a robber in there. [SPEAKER_E]: So what were you? [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah, as long as nobody. But if. [SPEAKER_A]: As long as no one robbed for me first and then I was the seer. [SPEAKER_E]: So what were you? [SPEAKER_C]: Did you. [SPEAKER_D]: Do you know what I am? [SPEAKER_E]: Pretty much. I just want to hear what you say. [SPEAKER_D]: If you know what I am, you know I would have no reason to lie. [SPEAKER_A]: Did you rob from me? [SPEAKER_D]: I'm Gonna keep it a secret because I think the Seer. The seer knows who I am and it's a safe secret. [SPEAKER_A]: Was he the robber? [SPEAKER_D]: I want to just. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I want to know why you're not saying it. [SPEAKER_D]: Because I just want to put doubt in the werewolves minds of what I possibly am. [SPEAKER_C]: You mean Eric's mind. [SPEAKER_A]: I am very confident that my card is not mine anymore. [SPEAKER_C]: The robber of the villager. [SPEAKER_A]: I am very confident that my card is not mine anymore. So what's. [SPEAKER_F]: What's he the seer now you're saying? [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, assuming something didn't happen tonight. [SPEAKER_A]: But unless he robbed for me first. [SPEAKER_C]: That could be a thing that happened. [SPEAKER_A]: And then now he's the werewolf. And well, Eric knows whether Eric knows the answer. [SPEAKER_D]: Eric knows. [SPEAKER_C]: Eric, Was he the robbery? [SPEAKER_A]: Because this deterrentary. We can go to a vote right away. [SPEAKER_D]: I was the villager. [SPEAKER_C]: Can you confirm that? [SPEAKER_E]: Why would you. No, he was a robber. Yeah. Why would you lie about that, Eric? [SPEAKER_D]: Eric's trying to. No, Eric's grasping for straws here. [SPEAKER_C]: Eric, can you answer? We just need to hear yes or no. Was he the robber? [SPEAKER_E]: No, he was not the robber. Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: He was the robber. [SPEAKER_E]: He was the robber. [SPEAKER_D]: I was not the robber. I was the villager. [SPEAKER_C]: So. [SPEAKER_A]: And he didn't steal from Justin? [SPEAKER_C]: Nope, he Paul. [SPEAKER_A]: So he could have stole from Paul, but I think he stole from me. [SPEAKER_D]: I was not the robber. I was the villain. [SPEAKER_A]: So who are you gonna kill, Eric? [SPEAKER_E]: No, no. [SPEAKER_C]: Who did you steal from? [SPEAKER_A]: I did steal from. [SPEAKER_E]: I can guarantee. I can guarantee there is only one werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Why would you be stealing? I can confirm that. Because he's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: He was trying to throw me under the butts to save himself. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: Center card werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Center card is werewolf. And the other one I pulled was villager. Okay, so. [SPEAKER_F]: Okay, so everyone needs to vote for Mike. I'm not the troublemaker. I'm a village. I didn't switch anybody. You're still a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: So he robbed me though. [SPEAKER_D]: I didn't. [SPEAKER_F]: Okay, possibly. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, so if he did not switch us now, do you want to tell the truth of what I was? [SPEAKER_E]: No, no, no. [SPEAKER_F]: You're not a werewolf. I didn't switch you. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, yeah, you're definitely a villager. It's him. [SPEAKER_A]: Hey, let's do it."}

We all get so defensive as the villagers. We need to win. Mike says he was the robber. I will say I was the seer. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, you guys aren't gonna fucking believe this, but I don't care. This is what happened. I was the troublemaker. Chad. [SPEAKER_F]: Eric was the villager. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: My role has already been claimed. [SPEAKER_F]: Nice. [SPEAKER_B]: Weird. Well, who did you see? [SPEAKER_D]: Why would I know why? Someone would. [SPEAKER_F]: Who? [SPEAKER_D]: I don't know who. Well, I would know who. The question is why. [SPEAKER_F]: No, Tanner's in the center. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, well, would you see? I want to know what he saw in the center. [SPEAKER_D]: Why? Why? So you think you saw Tanner in the middle? [SPEAKER_F]: Yep. [SPEAKER_D]: Why would a werewolf take my role? Anyone have an answer? [SPEAKER_B]: So you. You saying that you were the ceremony. [SPEAKER_D]: No, no. [SPEAKER_A]: Move into the center. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm saying I'm one of these four. [SPEAKER_A]: Which one? [SPEAKER_D]: I'm not a werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: Oh, not me. Right. [SPEAKER_D]: I want to figure out why that. Are you. [SPEAKER_E]: Are you just. [SPEAKER_F]: Okay, you cut me out. [SPEAKER_B]: Not tech asking you. I want to know if Justin's information is legit. Did. [SPEAKER_A]: Is it this role. [SPEAKER_D]: I know you're asking me. [SPEAKER_F]: This is the moment where you establish trust in me as a villager. If you're a villager, now is the. [SPEAKER_A]: Time to say the villager. [SPEAKER_F]: No, I mean, villager is just anyone on the side of the side of the good. [SPEAKER_B]: Any good side. The good. [SPEAKER_A]: Good guys. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: It wasn't you. [SPEAKER_B]: Trust. Okay, okay. [SPEAKER_F]: Oh, my God. [SPEAKER_B]: Troublemaker. [SPEAKER_E]: Why? [SPEAKER_B]: I don't possibly. [SPEAKER_E]: I don't understand, like, what you're. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. What are you trying to do? You are basically the werewolf, is what I know. My only question is, is there another werewolf at the table? Is this another werewolf? Because Mitch is a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: There are two werewolves, and you think. And they both. [SPEAKER_B]: It's a good idea. [SPEAKER_D]: Just grabbed one. After the two real people grabbed theirs, and the two werewolves just grabbed one. [SPEAKER_F]: They're saying one of them lucked out. [SPEAKER_D]: And the other got mine. Maybe that's why I am for sure a robber. If there's this one werewolf, why would he. Or she. [SPEAKER_F]: We need some talk from you guys. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: So if you're the troublemaker, who did you switch? [SPEAKER_E]: I switched Justin with somebody. [SPEAKER_F]: Great. [SPEAKER_A]: Did you actually get the troublemaker, though. [SPEAKER_E]: This time? [SPEAKER_B]: I did. I did. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_F]: Ramsey's right. After this round, I'll show the cards quickly. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, hey. Okay, what if. What if the Tanner took my role? Justin is a werewolf. And saw a seer in the middle. [SPEAKER_F]: You just confirmed that. You said I was a seer. [SPEAKER_A]: That you didn't. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I said it wasn't you who took my role. [SPEAKER_F]: I am a seer. And now I'm just throwing this out. This isn't a possibility. [SPEAKER_A]: Is there anyone else here at the table, a seer who can make this? [SPEAKER_D]: That's the only thing that can. That can explain what's happening to me right now. [SPEAKER_F]: I want to know what we're not. We have a 30. [SPEAKER_B]: Like, what role are you. I want to know what role you want to have. Like you want to have. [SPEAKER_E]: Because I think once. I think Mitch doesn't want to say what role he is, because as soon as the person who has that role hears him say it, then he's gonna. What am I trying to say? [SPEAKER_F]: Did you steal from someone? I don't care who. Yes or no, did you steal. Yes. [SPEAKER_A]: Who'd you steal from? [SPEAKER_B]: Can you confirm? [SPEAKER_F]: Guys, we have a minute. This isn't how villagers win. [SPEAKER_B]: Can you. [SPEAKER_F]: Hiding behind information. [SPEAKER_B]: I want to know what role you want. [SPEAKER_F]: I think we kill Mitchell. He's the only one who hasn't given out any information. [SPEAKER_E]: That literally makes the most sense. [SPEAKER_D]: Justin is the werewolf. The Tanner took my role. [SPEAKER_A]: Paul is the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: Paul is the Tanner. Justin is the werewolf. He saw a seer in the middle. [SPEAKER_E]: And now he's for sure a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Mitchell's for sure. Well, Mitchell. [SPEAKER_B]: No, no, wait. [SPEAKER_F]: Who did you steal from? [SPEAKER_B]: He's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: No, Tanner is in the center. Who did you switch? Who did you switch? [SPEAKER_D]: I just revealed my role. [SPEAKER_B]: I didn't switch anybody. [SPEAKER_D]: If anyone wants to use that. [SPEAKER_F]: But the Tanner is in the center. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. Did you switch anyone took my role? [SPEAKER_F]: Okay, so Paul took your eye. [SPEAKER_E]: Switch Justin with somebody. [SPEAKER_F]: Fuck. [SPEAKER_A]: This is. [SPEAKER_B]: This is the worst. There's two werewolves and a tanner, I believe. [SPEAKER_F]: There's no tanner's in the center. [SPEAKER_D]: I think Justin's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: I think there's two werewolves. [SPEAKER_F]: Who do we kill? Mike, who do we kill? [SPEAKER_E]: I don't know. [SPEAKER_A]: That's what I'm saying. Who did you switch? [SPEAKER_F]: No, there's no time because we don't fucking kill everyone."}

[SPEAKER_D]: I was the troublemaker. I was. [SPEAKER_C]: At this time, you were the troublemaker. [SPEAKER_F]: Here we go again. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: All right. We have a. We have a. Someone's taking my role. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't know why. [SPEAKER_F]: All right, what do I do? [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, so hold on. Let's do this this way. [SPEAKER_C]: K. K. No, no. Here's the thing. [SPEAKER_D]: Are you actually calling troublemaker? [SPEAKER_C]: This is what I want. This is what I want. Since you're both claiming troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: Both of you. [SPEAKER_C]: Who did you switch? Yes. [SPEAKER_F]: Mike and Eric. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, Mike and Eric. Or. [SPEAKER_F]: Or Justin and Paul. No, it's Mike and Eric. I switched my finger and you switched. [SPEAKER_D]: I said I switched. [SPEAKER_E]: Paul. And are you actually the troublemaker? [SPEAKER_F]: I'm gonna guess there's insomniac out there and they can verify. [SPEAKER_B]: That's a great. [SPEAKER_F]: They were switching. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Do we have an insomniac? [SPEAKER_F]: So I am saying it was you two. So if you were an insomniac, you could verify it. Or insomniac, you can verify that he's low battery. A lie. [SPEAKER_E]: So who is. Is there an insomniac at the table? [SPEAKER_C]: I'm gonna go out on a limb. Oh, sorry. And do this. I started as a werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: Oh, fascinating. So now which one of us is. [SPEAKER_D]: Which one of us is telling the truth? [SPEAKER_F]: Would. Okay, so obviously one of us is one of these. [SPEAKER_E]: Right? So who's the seer? [SPEAKER_D]: Why would you think that? [SPEAKER_F]: We can't both be a troublemaker. So one of us is lying. And these are the two roles that lie. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, fuck. Okay, so would. [SPEAKER_E]: I don't know. [SPEAKER_D]: I've lied as a villager before. [SPEAKER_B]: All right. [SPEAKER_F]: I think you're the Tanner. I think you're the werewolf. And now I think you're the Tanner, and he is whatever you used to be. And I don't. You're probably a villain. [SPEAKER_D]: So you did that. [SPEAKER_E]: You. You are claiming you did the switch? Yes. [SPEAKER_B]: Mitch, can we, like, touch fingers together, just. Neat. [SPEAKER_D]: Is this like I did? [SPEAKER_E]: This is real. [SPEAKER_C]: This is real. The troublemaker. [SPEAKER_F]: Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. [SPEAKER_B]: So here's what I'm thinking. It's gone down. Okay. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm a villager. [SPEAKER_B]: Or I'm, like, on the side of the villager. Here's the thing. I think Mike was the robber. Paul was the Tanner. They. Mike took Paul's role of the Tanner. They're both playing the Tanner game. [SPEAKER_E]: These. Both of these two are playing the Tanner game. [SPEAKER_C]: I like what you say. I'm not playing a Tanner game. I started as a werewolf. I don't think I'm a werewolf anymore. [SPEAKER_B]: Why not? [SPEAKER_C]: Because there's two troublemakers potentially. [SPEAKER_B]: So you switched? [SPEAKER_C]: There's a 50. 50 chance that. [SPEAKER_F]: Who were you? [SPEAKER_D]: You're the werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: You have to give some info. [SPEAKER_B]: I was the insomniac. [SPEAKER_D]: Did you wake up as insomniac? [SPEAKER_B]: Yes. [SPEAKER_F]: Ah. Bingo. [SPEAKER_D]: Shaboom. [SPEAKER_F]: They got switched. [SPEAKER_D]: So that's my story. [SPEAKER_F]: So why is he lying? He's either a robber and grabbed the werewolf, or he is a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: I think he was the robber that grabbed the Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: I think so too. [SPEAKER_F]: You make you a Tanner now, which would make. [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_C]: What were you. [SPEAKER_E]: No, there's another obvious role on the board that has no knowledge whatsoever. [SPEAKER_C]: You were something bad. [SPEAKER_E]: Because, trust me, if I was this. [SPEAKER_F]: You two. So I'm saying you're a Tanner because he was a Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: But what if I. What if I robbed. What if I was the robber and I robbed a werewolf, and I'm just trying to throw off a game. [SPEAKER_F]: If he. [SPEAKER_C]: If you robbed a bad thing, he switched you after. [SPEAKER_B]: Mm, yes. [SPEAKER_D]: Yes, that's true. [SPEAKER_C]: So what did. What were you before you got switched? [SPEAKER_D]: What were you? [SPEAKER_E]: I was the villager. [SPEAKER_C]: You robbed him? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_E]: That's what you're saying. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I didn't rob him. I was the Tanner from the beginning. Yeah, from the beginning, he was. So I'm just a villager and you're a werewolf? [SPEAKER_C]: No, that's. But why did you. [SPEAKER_F]: Why did you clean trouble me? [SPEAKER_C]: You were the villager from. [SPEAKER_F]: I'm trying to get voted. Let's not forget he. [SPEAKER_D]: I thought I was still the Tanner. What are you saying? [SPEAKER_C]: You were saying I was the tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: 100%. From the beginning, he said. I only said troublemaker. [SPEAKER_F]: No, he's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, I'm gonna admit something. No, if that's the case, he's actually a werewolf. Because I was a werewolf in the beginning. You were not. And as is he. Oh, for fuck's sake. It's these two now. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I wasn't actually. I was the village werewolves together. Why? [SPEAKER_E]: Why would a village be. [SPEAKER_C]: Because I want to get information. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah, but now you completely lost trust in me. I, I, I'm pretty sure you are a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_C]: Me, I'm not. You know, that's how I play it. I lie. [SPEAKER_E]: It's these two. [SPEAKER_F]: Oh, God, I have no idea. [SPEAKER_C]: No, no. [SPEAKER_E]: If you're troublemaking, this is the thing. [SPEAKER_C]: You can, you can tell that you just figured it out. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I think it's possible you can. [SPEAKER_C]: Tell that Eric just figured it out. [SPEAKER_F]: I'm the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: And Justin's, like, sitting here like, we. [SPEAKER_D]: Gotta vote for Paul. [SPEAKER_C]: No, they know. They know that I'm a good target still. [SPEAKER_B]: You're honest with this as a troublemaker? [SPEAKER_F]: I was a troublemaker. I switched those two. [SPEAKER_D]: But you're insomniac. You woke up as an insomniac. [SPEAKER_F]: Okay, Justin, I'm voting for whoever you vote for. [SPEAKER_C]: It's not me, I promise. I was a villager. [SPEAKER_E]: It's these two guys. [SPEAKER_C]: Who are you voting for? I believe you. [SPEAKER_E]: It's these two. [SPEAKER_C]: Which one do we vote for? We have five seconds of the two polls. [SPEAKER_D]: Paul. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, Yeah. I think Mike time is up, everyone."}

[SPEAKER_C]: And did you move anybody? [SPEAKER_D]: I did. I'm not revealing who yet. [SPEAKER_C]: No, I'm talking to golf. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, right. [SPEAKER_E]: Mike the troublemaker. We got it. That was an honest. [SPEAKER_A]: Wait okay, so you went first. I actually didn't move anyone. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, who did you switch? [SPEAKER_A]: I decided not to. [SPEAKER_E]: Look at me. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't want to right now. One of those bad norms. [SPEAKER_D]: One's. No one's saying. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. Or one of them's. The Searin is not revealed.

[SPEAKER_C]: Choose which. [SPEAKER_D]: I don't want to reveal that yet. [SPEAKER_C]: Why not? [SPEAKER_D]: Cause I don't want to reveal that yet. [SPEAKER_C]: Why do you keep doing that?

Can you give us some hints about what you are? [SPEAKER_D]: I don't want to incriminate somebody. [SPEAKER_E]: Now there's no more villagers to hide under. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Now it's all about powers. [SPEAKER_C]: Let's just say the reason why I'm trying to find out is because whoever has my roll now has a not good roll. [SPEAKER_E]: So you're a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: I will confirm I never switched you with anybody. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: So you still have that not good roll. [SPEAKER_C]: Assuming that somebody else didn't switch me. [SPEAKER_A]: Justin. Where were you? [SPEAKER_E]: I was all the above. [SPEAKER_A]: Tantalize. [SPEAKER_E]: I think you and I are working together now, Mitchell. [SPEAKER_A]: You think we're both werewolves? [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: I can confirm you're not what you are. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. That we just openly. So what should we do about our werewolf situation? [SPEAKER_D]: I 100% can confirm you are not who you are anymore. [SPEAKER_A]: Wow. Interesting. Who Just switch him with. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm not gonna say. I want to know what he was first. [SPEAKER_E]: So you were the village idiot and you didn't take this time to use this awesome ability? I don't believe that for one fucking second. [SPEAKER_A]: I don't think he was. I don't think he was. [SPEAKER_C]: You did. And the whole. Taking extra time. No, that wouldn't. Yeah, you. You moved them, man. [SPEAKER_A]: We're making no progress. [SPEAKER_E]: No progress. Villagers. You gotta step your. [SPEAKER_D]: Dude. [SPEAKER_A]: Oh. [SPEAKER_E]: All right, Mike. [SPEAKER_C]: So which direction did you spin everything? [SPEAKER_E]: I'm not who I say I am. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, which direction did you spin everything? Clockwise. Okay. And then you switched. [SPEAKER_A]: But not me. [SPEAKER_D]: I would do it before him though. [SPEAKER_C]: Before the drunk move things. [SPEAKER_A]: I do it last. [SPEAKER_E]: So now we're in a fucking. [SPEAKER_C]: Who did you switch? [SPEAKER_D]: I'm saying I switched him with somebody. [SPEAKER_C]: With who? [SPEAKER_E]: I started as a robber. [SPEAKER_D]: Who'd you rob? [SPEAKER_E]: I might have robbed my good friend Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: So what were you. Mitchell? [SPEAKER_E]: He was the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: So now you Were the Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: Yes. [SPEAKER_D]: And then I switched you two, and then he. [SPEAKER_E]: So Paul's a Tanner, and so you. [SPEAKER_D]: Moved, and then you moved everything clockwise? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: Cool. [SPEAKER_E]: That's what I started. No, no, no. [SPEAKER_D]: You didn't move. So whoever you were came here. [SPEAKER_E]: What were you? [SPEAKER_C]: Werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, right. [SPEAKER_C]: Let's vote for this guy. [SPEAKER_A]: You didn't actually switch everyone. [SPEAKER_E]: No, he did. [SPEAKER_A]: He went to the right. [SPEAKER_C]: He did switch everyone to the one minute remain. Yeah, he did. Yeah, he did. It's you. It's you that's. [SPEAKER_A]: It's not Mitchell. I knew it. [SPEAKER_D]: How do you know? [SPEAKER_E]: Did you go to the left? [SPEAKER_A]: He never does what he says he does. [SPEAKER_C]: He's not even. [SPEAKER_A]: He's not even the drunk. He's the freaking Seer. [SPEAKER_D]: He's just being sarmiac. [SPEAKER_E]: We have 40 seconds. Paul, if you're on the side of the village, you need to start giving information. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, if you're on the side of the village, even if you think you're a Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: Because if you switched us, Mitch is the Tanner and I'm the robber again. [SPEAKER_B]: So I want to be 30 seconds. [SPEAKER_A]: I started as a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: I 100% switched you two, and I'm. [SPEAKER_A]: Pretty sure I'm not anymore. [SPEAKER_D]: I 100% switched your two cards. [SPEAKER_C]: Paul, you did not switch as a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: I started as a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Why are you lying now? [SPEAKER_E]: Hey, Amaranth, how's it going? [SPEAKER_C]: You are straight up lying. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, this is. [SPEAKER_C]: I started as the werewolf. Son of a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: We need information. You're the only other villager here. [SPEAKER_A]: Four, three, two. [SPEAKER_E]: Cleric one. [SPEAKER_B]: Time is up, everyone. Three, two."}

Close your eyes. Werewolves. Wake up. I mean, you were right. It was going to be exciting, right? Yeah. Not in the way I thought it was, but still you. Your called shot was right. I'm glad I didn't die as Tanner. That would have been better. That would have been a top tier Tanner win. Like S rank. I like sabotaged myself by convincing Tyler by accident. Way too hard. No, it was something Mitchell said. Yeah, the moment he said he was voting Justin, that was. Wake up. That take me over and she'll do that. You may look at another player's card. Or two. Yeah. You haunted me. I felt so powerful every time you said anything about it. Close your eyes. Robber. Wake up. You may exchange your card with another player's card and then view your new card. Robert, close your eyes. Troublemaker. Wake up. You may exchange cards between two other players. Troublemaker. Close your eyes. Everyone wake up. That was my roll. Bullshit. Okay, if it was, what two cards did you look at? I looked at someone's card. Why are you fuckers playing? I like Tyler's idea. The thing is, the Minion is really strong in this game and we have to target people. Where are we here? Got a copycat. Okay. The thing is that James picks his role and then he thinks about the second role. He should. I'm trying to be seer. Trying to find the token. That's a good cover. Okay, I will say I did switch somebody with somebody else spicy some werewolf to me. Did you switch me, Tyler? I'm not gonna say yet. Not gonna say yet. I. I probably will say it because I'm proud of who I rod. Mr. The werewolf. He rob a werewolf? No, I seared him and he's a werewolf. No. James is a minion. No. Or a werewolf. No. Or a Tanner. No, Paul's not a werewolf. Or he might be, but Mitch is definitely not a robber. I am a robber and I robbed. Who'd you rob? I'm not saying it yet. For fuck's sake. Did you rob me? Can you confirm that I'm a seer? I am not saying yet, you fucking twit. He's. James just asked Mitchell. James just asked Mitchell to acknowledge that he is the Minion. That's what he just did. No, I didn't. Yeah, that's it. Okay, Cool. Cool, cool, cool. How does that translate? Yeah. How does that translate? So we kill. Here's what's up. Here's I'll tell you. Listen to these conspiring. I'll tell you what. Werewolves. Tyler's Tanner. James's minion. No. Mitchell's werewolf. No. And you are Sear. No. What are you? Doesn't matter. He's either copycat or robber. Then I like. No, there's a copycat in the. This is incredible. For Justin. Yes. And I think Paul took one of our roles. So one of us is gonna. How did I do that if you're the robber? Yeah, I'm not the robber. So I'm voting for Justin. For sake. I put. No, no. I have all this together. Just because I know who's claimed my role. Not because I saw anything. Just because I know who claimed my role and what else is happening and what everyone else is. So this is what has to happen. Okay. No, no, no. This is it. That has to be in the center. I looked at these two. That's what I saw. So here's the thing. How would I know that Tyler's Tanner? Because what else is the play? I'm the troublemaker. I know who I know, I'm confident what everyone's roles are and I know who has them. Right now. Paul, I don't even. You just tell me who to vote for. I need nothing else. I have to make sure I. Yeah, you just tell me when. I'll point the gun at that person. For the record, you have one of them wrong. Minion. He does. He does. But you're doing good. I won't tell you. That was like a 75 compliment 25 get in your head and manipulate you. So there. Okay, so there's no other way of getting heat on me at this point? No, no, no, no, no. Unless I switched you. But you just gave me that token. I didn't give it to you. Paul did. Oh, sorry, Tyler. Were you the Tanner? No, he's a minion. I don't know why. Regardless, you guys are gonna vote for me now. No, no. You literally were like, mitchell, I'm your minion. I didn't say that at all. I don't even know how you could get that. I heard you say it. I didn't say. You fucking liar. One minute left. This is what James does when he's in a corner. I'm gonna be voting for Justin. Ah, this is easy. We kill Mitchell. Sure. Yeah. Do I have kill Mitchell? No, you can't vote for me. You will lose this game. Why do we kill Mitchell. You want to kill Mitchell? I don't want him. Don't let him get in your head. Don't let him get in your head. Don't let him get in your head. Make your own choices. And you trouble Paul. I don't even. I don't care if you switch me off. I'm voting in your head. You troublemade us. Listen, I was the troublemaker. I know who everyone is. Impossible. You don't. He's in your head. Vote for Mitchell. I have to vote justice. What the fuck's happening? Or you lose. It's simple algebra, James. I love Justin. Physically, spiritually and, you know, sexually. I would. Are you pre voting? No. You got to vote for Justin if you want to win. You got five seconds. No, I can't just. It's Justin 100%. It's not Justin."}

Very suspicious and unlikely and does not look good for me. But I can confirm that someone at this table is lying. [SPEAKER_A]: I mean, we can vote left. You guys can all vote for me. I'm cool with either way. [SPEAKER_E]: Wait, if there's no werewolves. [SPEAKER_F]: Mitchell, did you look at a single card or two from the middle? [SPEAKER_D]: I looked at a single card. I like this trend. It's trendy. I'm a trendy guy who wants to follow the trend. [SPEAKER_A]: Single card. Single card is trending on Twitter. [SPEAKER_B]: Whose card did you. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, that's a lot. [SPEAKER_F]: That's a loaded question. [SPEAKER_C]: That's a loaded gun right there. [SPEAKER_A]: What did you switch Me? No, he switched me. [SPEAKER_E]: I switched to these two. And that's the extent of. [SPEAKER_A]: Are you being me? [SPEAKER_E]: What? [SPEAKER_A]: Are you being me? Are you gonna switch it, like, four times before the end? [SPEAKER_E]: No, I was literally just saying that's the extent of the information I have. [SPEAKER_C]: James gets intimidated by weaving multiple lies. [SPEAKER_E]: I do. I don't like lying to my friends. [SPEAKER_C]: And you can see because he just yells when he's lying. He grabs Tokyo. He's like, no, that was me. [SPEAKER_F]: You know, this game's a lot easier if you're just honest. [SPEAKER_E]: What am I doing right now for future rounds? I'm being honest right now. [SPEAKER_F]: Didn't say you weren't. [SPEAKER_C]: There are no werewolves with a Minion, and the rules are stupid. So the minion wins. If anyone else beside them dies. Villagers are screwed. We generally play with just that. If there's a lone minion, they basically become a werewolf. That's how we've always played. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, it's just the villagers out for blood and they get their blood. [SPEAKER_A]: Are you trying to stall for time by reading chat because you're a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: You know I'm a werewolf. You saw my thumb. [SPEAKER_B]: What? [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, boy. [SPEAKER_E]: What did you see, Rich? [SPEAKER_F]: He looked at a card. He looked at copycat. [SPEAKER_E]: What is that? [SPEAKER_D]: I can verify he was in fact copycat. [SPEAKER_E]: What did you copycat? [SPEAKER_F]: He copycatted something in the middle. So it's either a werewolf, a Tanner or a line. [SPEAKER_C]: I told you someone at this table is lying. I am one of the roles that was claimed. [SPEAKER_F]: So it's either a troublemaker or a minion. Because I robbed Mitchell and I switched you back. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: Or no, I switched you beforehand and you robbed back. [SPEAKER_F]: No, rob and then troublemaker. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. Cool. [SPEAKER_D]: You robbed me. [SPEAKER_F]: I did. [SPEAKER_D]: And then you swap us back. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_F]: So then Paul. Okay, so that means Paul is a werewolf for Tanner and he's a minion because he saying he's had a role that's claimed. [SPEAKER_D]: So you. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: What do you think he is? [SPEAKER_F]: A werewolf or a tanner? Because he says one of the roles is claimed, everyone else is pretty much. [SPEAKER_D]: Verified and you're sticking with Minion, so. [SPEAKER_A]: No, hold on. I have to figure out how to do this right. But yes, so far I am sticking. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. Okay. So the three of us. [SPEAKER_D]: So I looked at his card and you can verify that I was Seer, right? [SPEAKER_F]: Yes. Because I took your Seer card. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: And he was copycat. [SPEAKER_D]: Yes. [SPEAKER_E]: What happening? What is that? What kind of confirmation? [SPEAKER_C]: Yes. [SPEAKER_E]: Like, do you swear to tell the whole truth, nothing but the truth, so help you guys? The lawyer is like, all right, we're gonna do that. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: Mitchell. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, God. Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: Mitchell. [SPEAKER_D]: James. [SPEAKER_A]: You switched Tyler and Mitchell. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay. I'm inclined to believe him. Tyler was one of the werewolves and you are now a werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: Totally not. [SPEAKER_A]: If James switched you. [SPEAKER_D]: Why do you say that? [SPEAKER_A]: Because I was the minion. [SPEAKER_D]: But why are you? [SPEAKER_A]: And there's another werewolf out there and I'm not going to out them. There's three of us though. Like, we will win. [SPEAKER_E]: What? [SPEAKER_A]: Who? We have to vote. [SPEAKER_D]: Was it him or was it him? [SPEAKER_E]: How could. [SPEAKER_C]: You were never the fucking seer, were you? [SPEAKER_D]: He knows. [SPEAKER_A]: What? [SPEAKER_D]: That I was? [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_F]: I took a Seer card. [SPEAKER_A]: He didn't rob from you. [SPEAKER_D]: Who was it? There's no way your story doesn't check out. He was a Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: We cannot vote for him from the get go. Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Now the question is, why did he lie to you? [SPEAKER_A]: It doesn't matter. [SPEAKER_D]: We kill Mitchell, but it doesn't matter because you can verify me. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: We kill Mitchell. We kill Mitchell. [SPEAKER_D]: No, no, we're just. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm verified. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm voting. [SPEAKER_E]: You gotta kill Tyler. [SPEAKER_A]: You're verified by a liar. [SPEAKER_E]: No, you have to kill. Oh, no. Yeah, you gotta kill Mitchell. No, no. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, let's kill Mitchell. I voted. [SPEAKER_C]: Paul. [SPEAKER_A]: It's a good."}

Wake up and look at one of the center looking at the sand. It's you. What do you guys think I see right now? Just a butthole. How did you know? Crawl in them. Wake up and look for other werewolves. If there is only one werewolf, you may look at a card from the center. Yes. Close your eyes. Minion, Wake up. Werewolves. Stick out your thumb so the Minion can see who you are. I just want to be clear. If you're ever the Minion and you see me give you the finger. That's not a thumb. Close your eyes. Thank you. Wake up.

And then view your new card. Rocks. Close your eyes. Troublemaker, wake up. You may exchange cards between two other players. Troublemaker, close your eyes. Everyone, wake up. We got a claim from James that he's the Seer. I'm not gonna lie this time, and I'm not gonna get shabby, but I'm not gonna tell you any more than that on the Seer. Can you tell me one thing? I looked at Tyler's card. I don't think that that card is a Seer. That made me reach my steps. Goal literally just went off. Oh, God. Okay. All right. Well, we killed 45 seconds there. What'd you see? What? What'd you see in Tyler's car? Yeah. I want to see more information on the table. Can I ask you one question? What did you see? Not gonna get me twice with that face. I really don't think you're the Seer with that face. So you're claiming Seer. I am claiming Seer because I saw a card in the middle. I saw two cards in the middle. What cards you see in the middle? I saw at least one werewolf in the middle. That's how that happened. So you copycat it into the Seer. Wow. He's claiming two. I'm gonna just put this here if that's okay. That's all good. Yeah. I'm just gonna put this sear. You do Okay. A bit better. All right. Mitch, what were you. No, Justin, what were you Sure. I was a troublemaker. How about you now, what were you? I wasn't that so for reference, he pushed away the robber. The last. Good roll here. Okay. So how you. You saw a werewolf in the center? Yeah. James, we're in trouble. I saw werewolf in the center. So the only way he could have done that Is by being a werewolf, right? Yeah. Assuming what you're saying is true. Yeah, assuming what I'm saying is true. Let's all believe my lie. Or. Or I could be lying. He could be. Is there a robber out there? So what the fuck is going on here? Don't look at me. All right. Is there a robber out there? I don't know. I feel like we have three baddies here. I did switch. I didn't switch you. Good. Why should I believe you? Because I'm telling the truth. Cool. You shouldn't. I was the troublemaker. Paul's lying. I have nothing else to say about that. Hey, Mitchell. Yeah. Who did you rob from? That's a minion confirmation right there. Pardon? Paul Stanner. Oh, that's a good. That's a good guess. I. Robin Paul. But you said you weren't the robber. Yeah. And now you're claiming to be robber after someone's prompted you to claim robber. So you have no original thought in your head. That's right. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. You're robbed for me. Yeah. We're in trouble. Yeah. The only thing is one of them is not gonna win. They're gonna think they're gonna win and they're gonna lose. And we can choice in that. You know what your role is, who you're gonna vote for? Good question. Not sure yet. You said you troublemaked people. I did. But you haven't revealed who. Correct. And I'm likely not going to because hopefully it'll make one of them realize they're gonna lose and we might start to get some info. And if not, I'm just gonna vote. Okay. So who are you gonna vote for? Hold on. I'll tell James at the last second in the center. That's really like rude. No, no, no. Who are you voting for? I don't know. I need some help. Yeah. Yeah. We're in trouble. Tyler, who are you voting for? I've got two choices. I got two choices right now. That's cool. What are they? I don't know. I have to narrow it down still. Paul, name someone. Let them work. Okay. I guess Justin. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Sure, sure. Well, for fun. Well, I guess since he's not going to tell us who he trouble made. I think it's Justin. Yeah. It's got to be sure. That's fair. But what if that's a Tanner play from Justin? I don't think Justin's playing 10 or I'm not. Yeah, I don't think he's playing 10. It's okay. We're gonna. If it is earned are very small. Did you trouble make? It doesn't matter. We have two werewolves and a minion. I'm sorry, we've lost. Was anyone actually the copycat? Cuz I was just the robber and I robbed from you. Yeah, so I don't know what's going on out there."}

[SPEAKER_A]: Sometimes we even go to one thing. Yeah. So I think we can do one. [SPEAKER_D]: I keep forgetting to put it down. So remind me before we start the next game. [SPEAKER_A]: So we have. Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: What the. What? [SPEAKER_A]: So we have sear. Is James saying he's sear. Laura, Insomniac. Mitch saying he's robber. Paul and I have said nothing. James is a Tanner and werewolf in the center, but juicy. [SPEAKER_F]: I will say that I switched with Mitch and that's why he is the robber now. And I'm the insomniac because I was the robber. [SPEAKER_E]: That's a lot of information all at once. [SPEAKER_D]: Can you verify or. Oh, you did that. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah, I'm just hoping. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't give a. About you guys. I like to see. [SPEAKER_D]: That's pretty good. [SPEAKER_C]: That's more that you get more information by seeing. [SPEAKER_E]: I can confirm someone is lying. Someone has taken my role and put it somewhere. [SPEAKER_F]: It's James. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I'm one of the. I'm one of the things on the board. [SPEAKER_F]: Oh, you're the Tannerman. [SPEAKER_C]: No, he's the werewolf. I'm the seer, obviously. What are you doing? [SPEAKER_D]: What are you. Paul. That makes no sense. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Paul is a werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: Guaranteed, these two chips. [SPEAKER_E]: No. What do you mean, guaranteed? [SPEAKER_C]: Paul? [SPEAKER_A]: Why? [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, fair. [SPEAKER_D]: Because what you said makes no sense. [SPEAKER_E]: One of you has taken. [SPEAKER_D]: Including these. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, including these. Took one of my rolls and put it on here. Obviously not the werewolf, because it could just be the other one if that person. But somebody's lying about one of these. [SPEAKER_A]: I haven't said anything yet. [SPEAKER_E]: Yes. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. Yeah, let's bring it up. Justin, what would you like to say? [SPEAKER_D]: Highly suspicious. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. But you'll understand when I explain who I am. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, yeah. We'll leave it to 30 seconds before the. [SPEAKER_E]: I won't. I'll go sooner than that. [SPEAKER_D]: Hunter. [SPEAKER_A]: You're the hunter that would lead. [SPEAKER_D]: Troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: So nobody was a troublemaker. Nobody switched anything? Is that what we're saying? [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, I buy this. That sounds like that pans out. You're obviously lying. [SPEAKER_C]: Nope. [SPEAKER_E]: Yes. I was a seer. [SPEAKER_C]: You're a liar. [SPEAKER_E]: I was a seer. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay. [SPEAKER_E]: 100%. [SPEAKER_C]: No, you're a dirty liar. [SPEAKER_E]: And I know James. [SPEAKER_A]: Can I ask a question? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: This Tanner in the center, Are you maybe lying to try to get information? Is Paul maybe the Tanner? [SPEAKER_C]: No. No. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay. You saw the Tanner. Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. I'm not smart enough to play that way, so. That's a good idea, though. [SPEAKER_A]: Peanut butter baby hugs you for no reason. [SPEAKER_C]: What did I. Oh, we should do. [SPEAKER_E]: What did I say we should do if we're the seer? [SPEAKER_C]: I don't know. I don't. What? [SPEAKER_E]: Look at James. [SPEAKER_A]: But James can't look at himself if he's the seer. [SPEAKER_E]: I know, because he wasn't. I was, and I looked at James. [SPEAKER_A]: What did you see? [SPEAKER_E]: He's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: No, 100%. [SPEAKER_D]: Clearly, one of them is the Tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, I can agree with now. [SPEAKER_E]: Now here's. [SPEAKER_A]: Here's. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, so one of the Tanner ones in sear. The Tanner did call out two, but these are two easy ones to call out. [SPEAKER_C]: What? [SPEAKER_D]: Because no one's gonna be like, oh. [SPEAKER_E]: If I was the Tanner, I would want you to vote for me. I don't want you to vote for me. I don't want you to vote for James. Justin is the only possible werewolf at this point because I know what he is, and I feel really good about what you guys are. [SPEAKER_A]: That's true. [SPEAKER_F]: And no one's called out. Troublemaker. [SPEAKER_A]: Here's the thing, though. I don't want you to kill me because I don't think there's a werewolf here. I only think there's a Tanner here. Right. So if you kill me, I have to vote for somebody. Don't. [SPEAKER_E]: Don't vote for him. [SPEAKER_A]: That's the thing. Don't kill me because I'm gonna have to take with me. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm gonna stick to my vote for Justin. I will. No, no, listen. [SPEAKER_A]: Oh, my. [SPEAKER_E]: This would totally. [SPEAKER_C]: No, that wouldn't work. [SPEAKER_E]: If I was the Tanner. I was gonna say kill me, but no, don't kill me. [SPEAKER_C]: No, this is. This is what I saw. A hundred percent. [SPEAKER_E]: I saw that solid Tanner strategy to just go with his original lie, but not put any. [SPEAKER_A]: I think they're both playing fine suspicious and likely games. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, let's be real. [SPEAKER_A]: James came out first. [SPEAKER_E]: Here's the thing. Promise for 100% he did come over. [SPEAKER_B]: One minute remaining. [SPEAKER_C]: Paul did. [SPEAKER_E]: This is James's go to like an open pass games. This is go to Tanner. Peace. [SPEAKER_A]: Not really. [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_A]: Every time James is tenors, he said he's been. [SPEAKER_E]: No, not okay. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, but I. I don't pay attention to that. I'm walking on just this game. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, what are you voting? [SPEAKER_A]: Okay, I'm more likely to go Paul if it's just these two. [SPEAKER_E]: I was the seer and I'm gonna get killed. That's mental. No, that's mental. Okay, I'm. We only have one minute or 30 seconds. Okay, 100. James is the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: No kill Mitch. [SPEAKER_E]: James is the Tanner. I was. So you were the robbery. [SPEAKER_F]: I was and then I switched. I know. [SPEAKER_A]: And you? I can verify this. [SPEAKER_D]: I woke up as robber. Now, Paul did say he agrees with this. Yeah, that's something I don't. [SPEAKER_E]: It's not a lot. [SPEAKER_D]: You gotta do a vote. [SPEAKER_A]: Who's everyone going for? [SPEAKER_E]: I'm voting for Justin. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm voting left. [SPEAKER_A]: Oh, don't for left."}

[SPEAKER_B]: Everyone close your eyes. Werewolves. Wake up and look for other werewolves. If there is only one werewolf, you may look at a card from the center. [SPEAKER_C]: What do you see, Mitch? [SPEAKER_A]: I saw another werewolf. It was you, James. [SPEAKER_D]: Check. [SPEAKER_B]: Close your eyes. [SPEAKER_D]: Very suspicious. [SPEAKER_B]: Wake up and look. [SPEAKER_D]: These are Masons. Masons. Wake up and look for other Masons. [SPEAKER_C]: What do you see? Laura? [SPEAKER_B]: Close your eyes. [SPEAKER_D]: Troublemaker. I didn't see darkness. [SPEAKER_B]: You may exchange cards between two other players. Troublemaker. Close your eyes. Insomniac. Wake up and look at your card. Insomniac. Close your eyes. Everyone, keep your eyes closed and reach out and move your card over. [SPEAKER_A]: I forgot to change the roll timer. [SPEAKER_D]: I'll never remember ever thought of making the board big. And the faces the Wake up. The picture. Picture we do for most of our games. But this one is a very social game. So we're staying big in this one because there's a lot of talking in this one. Larissa, she's the insomniac. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you wake up and see Insomniac? [SPEAKER_E]: I did. [SPEAKER_C]: Wowee. [SPEAKER_E]: How boring. [SPEAKER_D]: Any Masons? Does anyone want to do the Mason? [SPEAKER_A]: For the first time, I know there is a Mason out there. [SPEAKER_E]: Sears. [SPEAKER_D]: How do you know? [SPEAKER_A]: That kills him. The Mason. And there's only one. [SPEAKER_D]: No. He thought the Seer was in here. And now he's just like, oh, no. [SPEAKER_A]: I was a Mason, and I woke up alone. And I scanned real quick, and I went back and forth and I panicked because there was no other Mason. I felt alone. [SPEAKER_D]: I was El Huntor. [SPEAKER_A]: El Huntoro. [SPEAKER_E]: So that's what you're saying. [SPEAKER_D]: Somewhere in the center. [SPEAKER_A]: Somewhere. [SPEAKER_D]: And I'm Paul and James. They haven't said anything. So you're one of the four. I'm one of the three. One of the three. Okay. James, are you one of the three or one of the one? [SPEAKER_C]: Tough question. I want to see what Paul says. [SPEAKER_D]: That's what I'm saying. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, man. [SPEAKER_D]: This is a nightmare. [SPEAKER_C]: You say something. Fucking. I'll ride out five minutes. I don't care. [SPEAKER_A]: I love playing with James. I will also. [SPEAKER_C]: All right. [SPEAKER_A]: So should we go to vote and vote for the person with the werewolves. [SPEAKER_D]: In front of them? [SPEAKER_A]: Sure. [SPEAKER_E]: But he could also be the Tanner. Unless he's using that as a camouflage. [SPEAKER_D]: I just don't get this. [SPEAKER_A]: We'll always. [SPEAKER_D]: If one of them is the troublemaker, they want to talk. Otherwise, they're not playing to the intention of the game of winning. [SPEAKER_E]: So neither of them is a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_A]: Fascinating. [SPEAKER_D]: Fascinating. Which? [SPEAKER_E]: I mean, are you werewolf One or werewolf two? [SPEAKER_A]: Vengeance. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm the troll. [SPEAKER_A]: Cool. [SPEAKER_C]: Who did you switch? Yeah, this is nobody. [SPEAKER_D]: Nobody. [SPEAKER_C]: I realized just like, eyes closed. And I was like, troublemaker. Close your eyes. Like. Oh, just missed. [SPEAKER_D]: All right, so either he's doing another James Tanner and he wants to go 4 for 4, or he's James troublemaker and forgot to open his eyes. [SPEAKER_A]: I believe that's a possibility. [SPEAKER_D]: So then Paul's one of these. [SPEAKER_C]: I was just hoping I could. That's the only information I'd be able to give is that I was the troublemaker and Paul is not. [SPEAKER_A]: If he is one of these three, I mean, it's a 60% chance he's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Let's fucking just kill him. [SPEAKER_A]: Slow down. [SPEAKER_D]: We'll slow down. [SPEAKER_C]: Damn. [SPEAKER_A]: Let's look at everyone else's stories. I mean, this. [SPEAKER_D]: All of us. Yeah. All of us are unconfirmed as well. [SPEAKER_A]: There are no. He hasn't spoken. So I do highly suspect he is one of the three. [SPEAKER_C]: I think he's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: I think he's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: Let's vote left. Do it. [SPEAKER_D]: I don't think it. James is the Tanner because he's saying vote left. And that's a very noble thing to do. [SPEAKER_C]: Thank you. [SPEAKER_D]: And you actually forgot to switch anybody. You didn't switch anybody? [SPEAKER_C]: No. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. [SPEAKER_A]: I think just the odds are 60% chance he's a werewolf. 30% chance he's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: Like, those are good odds. That's why I said let's gank him. But at the end of the day, no. [SPEAKER_D]: But he'd be talking if he was a werewolf. If he's a Tanner, he's just gonna let the kill wash over him. [SPEAKER_A]: I agree. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. Right now. Especially on that. Yeah, Yeah. I think he's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_A]: I agree. [SPEAKER_D]: I think we gotta vote to the left. [SPEAKER_C]: I think Justin's a werewolf now. [SPEAKER_A]: Justin might be. [SPEAKER_D]: I might be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: I could be. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, fuck. Other options. [SPEAKER_E]: They both could be werewolves. [SPEAKER_A]: That reaction makes me trust her. I don't think she's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Let's. [SPEAKER_D]: So is the fact that I'm not trustworthy. Like, what am I doing that makes me. [SPEAKER_A]: No, nothing. [SPEAKER_D]: It's just I've been pushing conversation to try to get this going. [SPEAKER_A]: But you've done it before as a. [SPEAKER_D]: Werewolf and you played. There's no before. This is just. Right now. I'm telling this. This is all the information I have. This is a game right now. Because we took out all the big things for the village. We need to work together to deduce this. [SPEAKER_A]: So what are you saying? That there's no werewolf? [SPEAKER_D]: I'm thinking there's no werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: I think there's two werewolves. By that story, you wouldn't kill anybody. [SPEAKER_D]: But you know what? [SPEAKER_C]: I have no reason to think that, other than raw suspicion. I think we got a vote left on the off chance Paul is the Tanner. We got a vote left? Yeah, because it's either both of them are werewolves or Paul's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: What if Justin's the werewolf? [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, well, then the werewolf and you vote left. [SPEAKER_C]: Everybody wins. I win. Yeah, so it. [SPEAKER_A]: No, I'll win because all for the votes. [SPEAKER_D]: This is Tanner talk, right? No, if you're gonna be a little. Mike, don't be a mic. [SPEAKER_C]: Who's the little. [SPEAKER_D]: No, not you. Just the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: Mitch, are we ganking Justin or voting left? [SPEAKER_A]: Vote left. Okay, if I'm the Tanner, I'll vote left. [SPEAKER_D]: But if I'm a werewolf, I'll vote. Oh, yeah. If you're a werewolf, vote for somebody. [SPEAKER_B]: Time is up."}

Okay, so it's like one second now, so you gotta go for your action. Werewolves, wake up and look for other werewolves. If there is only one werewolf, you may look at a card from the center. Werewolves, close your eyes. Masons, wake up and look for the other Mason. Mason, close your eyes. Masons. Troublemaker, wake up. You may exchange cards between two. James, are you laughing? A little bit. Troublemaker, close your eyes. Insomniac, wake up. And the pussyholic follow date. James, Insomnia. Be like. This is not the Instagram for you. Keep your eyes closed and reach out and move your card around slightly. Yeah, and I actually only went from three to two, so we can still go down to one. But it's still like the talking, then the seconds, then the whatever. Right, so even one is pretty decent. You think? James. We vote for James. No, I was. Three, two, one. James. Woah. No. What are you. What? Just in case you messed up and slept through your turning. Nice. Bold. Do we have any Masons that saw other Masons? We have one Mason. Who did you switch, James? I don't know. You don't know? I switch. We have one Mason. I hope I didn't get switched as a werewolf. Well, I hope he. Who are you, Justin? Mitch. You're the werewolf, aren't you? No. No. You're thinking of a strategy right now I'm trying really hard to figure out your strategy. My strategy as a werewolf of what? I'm waiting for you guys to. I was either a hunter or the insomniac. I am one of those. So I know which when you are, if you're being truthful. I am being truthful. So now Justin. So Laura's a werewolf or a tanner. That seems like a Tanner move to draw the attention. Or a werewolf move to try to draw the attention. Okay, but it's a move. It's an ambiguous move. So you're one of these, Mitchell? Yes. So we know who each other are. Yes. Great fist bump. If you and I are both being truthful, then we both now know who we are. What the fuck are you saying you are? I'm one of those two and I'll run with him till the end of the fucking earth. That sounds like fucking this. Yeah, it does. It does. But you know, Mitch and I always will respond with yes, it does. No, we're not werewolves. We are these two roles. Her reaction makes me think she is a Tanner. Oh, I was gonna say makes me think that she's the werewolf because we took the. Maybe she's Double doubling me the heat off of her. If she is a werewolf. James, I underestimated her. I never catch Justin when he's a werewolf and he always gets by me. So I feel like Justin, I need to know if you're gonna fuck shit up. Can you tell us one of the people you switched with by chance or one person you didn't switch? Like, I feel like that's a troublemaker. Cuz your story might change two or three times in the next two. Because it's a troublemaker. I switched Paul more. Whoa. Okay, snap. So. So I'm one of those shitty things. So what were you originally Laura? Oh, no. I hope you're low key secretly. The Tanner. And you're just helping me out being the Tanner. You're like, I'm gonna play for team Tanner. I highly suspect James did not switch those two. I kind of think so too. I. I'm like 50. 50. If James is even telling anything truthful right now. Like based like. Sorry, going back to past games. But like there's such a. What? Chaotic variable. Are you standing by that? Yeah. So you would vote for Paul? I got the troublemaker again. I was like, I'm gonna make use of this. I fucking swapped the two closest cards to me in a panic because. So if we were to go to a vote, this is who you would vote for. And you want us to vote for Paul as well? Assuming Laura's telling the truth. Yeah, Yeah, I would. I would. I would do that. Because why would she fucking. If she calls werewolf or Tanner, why would she give. Pass the Tanner off to Paul and get him killed? What? How do you feel about that story to me? I think. Let's gang Paul every. See, this is why I like lying as a villager. Because by saying I was Mason right away I'm in a. I know. I. I feel like there might be. But because I'm on the board, I think Justin might be a Tanner. Why do you think that? I want you to tell me which one of those I am. Yeah, I want you to do that. I think this might be the same logic you're trying to put as me. It's possible. So how about we go under the table, give each other little finger kisses. No, you should do that. What? One minute remaining. Laura. You swear you were the werewolf? I was the werewolf. He's lying. Justin's lying. Mitchell's line. So he came to me first because he was trying to trap me. So I smoked things up a bit to get it on him. Justin is lying. So I need the help from the villagers to add that up. Why would you choose no? You're trying to fucking. So which one are you then? I was the hunter. No, no, no, no. You know what? Full disclosure. I'm only 60 to 70% sure I was the hunter. I am 100% sure I am the hunter. I think they're trying, so I apologize in advance. They're trying to find the story between us that doesn't add up. I switched Paul and Laura. That's all I believe in. James, if Laura was a werewolf, we gotta vote. Paul. I'm voting that way because why the fuck would she say, yeah, let's fucking go. I think that Justin's a Tanner and he's trying to throw a wrench in it. I'm gonna vote for Justin because I think for me. No. Okay, whichever one of you is the web vote."}

Everyone, close your eyes. Werewolves, wake up and look for other werewolves. If there is only one werewolf, you may look at a card from the center. Werewolves, close your eyes. That is fast.

Insomniac, wake up and look at your card. Insomniac, close your eyes. Everyone, keep your eyes closed and reach out and move your card around slightly. Everyone. I like Disney's logic. Can I go first? Yeah, of course. I. I had a question. Before Paul goes, I want it. Who was the troublemaker and what did they do? No, let me go first. Let me go first. No, no, because this is what I want to know. This is. That's. That's. Yeah, that's high five. Okay, so James's answer to my question is no, you can't go first. No. Okay. Before Paul goes, would anyone like to claim Troublemaker and say something? If not, then Paul, be my guest. I'm gonna wait. I want to see what Paul's gonna say. Okay. I am not going to claim my role right away. Listen, number one, I didn't cheat accidentally this time. I am not going to claim my role. I'm not going to say my role until they're both werewolves. Until somebody. Until somebody claims my role. All right? And then I will immediately. At which point I will immediately call them out on that lie. I won't wait. So we just talked for a minute. So she's a hunter and she had no info because she's a hunter. I was a Mason and I was alone. James, can we know why you were so adamant about wanting the troublemaker? Who do we gang? I was not the hunter or the Tanner. Mitchell's lying. I was Mason. That's what I was waiting for. There's two Masons. Yeah, but we would have seen each other. No, I'm just kidding. I just couldn't fucking do that. You actually almost would have had me there if you were a werewolf. And you're like. You didn't even fucking see me. Because I literally was like. And I was like one second. So anyone open, it was me. So Mitchell tried to lie at the beginning. Did you put this Okay, I thought you put it them yourself. So, yeah, I'm suspicious, Mitchell, because I. This is what I was. This is my strategy. Went to sleep as a villager and woke up as an alien. He promptly executed himself. That seems legit. Alrighty, so you're a Mason? I'm a Mason. I'm a troublemaker. Did you swap me with anyone? I didn't swap you. I was the insomniac. I did not wake up as myself, so I. Yes. Who did you swap? Can you confirm a story at the table? Yes. Which one? I want to hear it from you. But this would put you in the clear. Yeah, but I want to put you in the clear. I mean, I've already. I said right out the bat that I have been swapped. Mm. So you and you verified that? Yes, so you've already verified. So I want you to verify your story to me. No, I've already verified mine to yours. To you. I verified. I said I want you to do that too. I want you to tell us who you swapped him with. All right. I switched with you. He's a Mason now. With him. Oh, so Mitch wasn't lying. In a fucking weird way, sure. But now I think Mitch is a werewolf. If I was werewolf, I would come clean right now that I got swapped with him. I wasn't werewolf. Left Killora. Yeah. What? Kill the hunter. She points at me. Wait. Yeah, I have to figure out who's the real werewolf. No, I don't think there is a werewolf. I was a werewolf. You were? Yeah. Who'd you really switch with? I switched you two. Oh. I couldn't verify who you swapped me with. I didn't even know I got swat. Now I do. Now I am the Mason that I originally claimed to be. Oh, that makes sense. That you were the werewolf. Oh, fuck. Everything falls into place and I'm the werewolf. And you guys know it. Damn it. Kill Paul. Kill Paul. Kill Paul. Vote to the left. I'll vote left. I'm good to vote now. If you guys are. I was the insomniac and I woke up as werewolf. One rid remaining. Shit. I thought I could fucking do that. Oh, I was the other werewolf. And you know what? I must have taken too long to go with Mitchell. So I guess it's 50. 50 between me and Mitchell, whichever one of us you want to kill, because Mitch is still no werewolf. I did switch Mitch with you. Yeah. And I was. I was a werewolf. To me. Yeah, we were both werewolves. And you got us no guarantee. You're a troublemaker. No one can verify that. Except for the fact that Mitch backed me into corner, even though it was an obvious werewolf tactic, and I responded in an effort to help the villagers. Well, I'm in Tanner, so I really don't give a shit. That's true. You are. Do you wanna, like, what? You wanna kill me? I'll kill you after. Like it won't count, but, like, I'll do it. Oh, my God. What if James is the werewolf? I'm not a werewolf. I was the werewolf. So we kill Paul. I was. That's all I know is I was the only one. Yeah. All right. Let's kill Paul. Okay. Time is the."}

[SPEAKER_F]: Would you want to tell us? [SPEAKER_E]: No, not yet. [SPEAKER_C]: Was there a troublemaker out there? [SPEAKER_E]: Him and I would know what the other one is. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, yeah, because you're both assuming we're. [SPEAKER_E]: Both telling the truth. Last time, one of us was lying. [SPEAKER_C]: So? [SPEAKER_E]: So we'll force each other to pick one out later. [SPEAKER_A]: Peanut butter burp. [SPEAKER_C]: Peanut butter burp. [SPEAKER_D]: What do you guys. [SPEAKER_E]: Guys, we gotta make progress. [SPEAKER_C]: I want to know if there's a troublemaker out there. [SPEAKER_E]: Why would you care, Mr. Werewolf? [SPEAKER_C]: Because I was a Tanner. Did I get swapped? Anyone? Do we need to gank someone? No, you don't yeah, right. Do we need to not kink someone? [SPEAKER_B]: Lauren, Paul, can we get some information, please? [SPEAKER_D]: I didn't swap. [SPEAKER_E]: So one of you. [SPEAKER_B]: I don't need to. [SPEAKER_D]: I don't need to give information this round. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, so there's a villager that doesn't want to win. Got it. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I, I, it's. I, I just need to figure things out. [SPEAKER_E]: Well, you gotta also make sure we trust you. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. Okay. [SPEAKER_C]: So you guys. You two are claiming to be. I vault the hunter insomniac. [SPEAKER_D]: Collectively, I think you guys will trust me. [SPEAKER_C]: Laura. [SPEAKER_F]: That's interesting, because I'm also one of these two. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, snap. That really makes this werewolf shine for me, doesn't it? [SPEAKER_E]: What are you? [SPEAKER_C]: I'm a Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: What the fuck? Okay, so. [SPEAKER_D]: This is the first time I understand everything tonight. This is amazing. [SPEAKER_E]: So, Paul, you need to help me understand it. [SPEAKER_C]: Nope. [SPEAKER_D]: Because I. Well, I only understand of what has been released. [SPEAKER_E]: So everyone has claimed something but you. [SPEAKER_D]: I know who. [SPEAKER_E]: Nothing makes sense. [SPEAKER_D]: I know who to trust at this point. And I know who I'm iffy about still. [SPEAKER_E]: So if you're taking so either one. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, someone just fast. Was there a troublemaker? Did they swap me? [SPEAKER_F]: I just. I want to know which one. Wait. I want to know which one Mitches first. Are you a hunter or insomniac? [SPEAKER_B]: I'm a hunter. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, I was the hunter. [SPEAKER_B]: I'm the hunter. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm the hunter. [SPEAKER_B]: Fuck, man. I'm. Now. [SPEAKER_D]: Was Mitch saving that. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, for whatever I said. [SPEAKER_E]: I've done it before because I was. [SPEAKER_F]: The insomniac, so I was hoping you wouldn't say you were the insomniac. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, I was hoping. Sounds werewolf y. [SPEAKER_F]: No. [SPEAKER_C]: So. [SPEAKER_E]: So this is very. Either one of us is a Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: Someone needs to fucking tell me I'm a Tanner. Was there a troublemaker out there? [SPEAKER_D]: I think there was. [SPEAKER_C]: There was no troublemaker. [SPEAKER_E]: So what are you. [SPEAKER_C]: So we're claiming that that was in there. [SPEAKER_B]: I also would like to know if there was a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: Paul, are you the fucking troublemaker? [SPEAKER_E]: Do we. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh my gosh. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm gonna make a bold fucking. [SPEAKER_E]: There's two masons. There's two masons. [SPEAKER_B]: Two masons in this. [SPEAKER_E]: There's two masons, two masons remaining. There's two masons. [SPEAKER_B]: How many masons are there? [SPEAKER_E]: There's two masons. Clever. [SPEAKER_D]: Or there's two werewolves. [SPEAKER_E]: Huh? I'm. [SPEAKER_B]: Look at that. [SPEAKER_D]: What if there's two werewolves and two masons? [SPEAKER_C]: I don't. [SPEAKER_B]: We have 40 seconds. [SPEAKER_E]: That works out pretty good. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, well, was. Okay, was anyone a troublemaker? Are they fucking wrong? [SPEAKER_E]: Cause you can be suspicious, and I. [SPEAKER_D]: Don'T think there was a troublemaker. I think we have to, like, ignore that. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, no troublemaker. So no one can confirm your guys's story. [SPEAKER_D]: Like, don't vote for James. Well. [SPEAKER_F]: Well, James could be him. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, but what the is going on here with this? Like, you. All three of you think that, you know, I'm. [SPEAKER_F]: No, I'm gonna. [SPEAKER_A]: I'm the insult. [SPEAKER_C]: Are you a Mason? Justin? [SPEAKER_D]: You trusted them. Who do you vote for? [SPEAKER_B]: I was a Mason. [SPEAKER_F]: Why would you say you're a hunter? [SPEAKER_B]: You know, I don't know. [SPEAKER_E]: Because I think he has the other Mason's trust. Okay, we gank Justin.

[SPEAKER_E]: Okay. [SPEAKER_A]: I love it. [SPEAKER_E]: I was the seer. And I can confirm somebody's story because I looked at a card for a player, not in the center. Oh. [SPEAKER_C]: I was the insomniac. I woke up the insomniac. [SPEAKER_E]: So, Mitch, you're saying you're the robber? You're saying you're the villager? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_A]: I can also verify one of the stories. [SPEAKER_D]: So Paul's a werewolf. I can't verify shit, but I fucked around with some shit. [SPEAKER_C]: Mulkitsch. Mulkich. So Jim isn't lying. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, this should go quickly. [SPEAKER_E]: James is the insomniac. He was the one I looked at. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you wake up? [SPEAKER_D]: I appreciate you looking at James as per the strategy. So if you were saucier and you're a werewolf, I appreciate the lie. [SPEAKER_C]: I promise you this. If we all vote left this time, I will not be out for blood. I will vote to the left. That's my proviso. Because I have no input, no suspicion. [SPEAKER_A]: You're verified. [SPEAKER_E]: You can confirm a story? [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. Yeah, I can confirm your story. [SPEAKER_E]: My story? [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. Who did you rob? [SPEAKER_C]: You robbed. [SPEAKER_A]: I robbed Justin's. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, okay. That's cool. [SPEAKER_C]: So who'd you switch? [SPEAKER_D]: Because I switched you with somebody. [SPEAKER_C]: But troublemaker goes. [SPEAKER_D]: Here's the thing. Were you werewolf? No, because I. I promise I switched you with somebody. [SPEAKER_F]: No, I was a villager. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, no. Troublemaker. No, he's not out of order. [SPEAKER_D]: So all three of these are the bag, we're saying? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I'll vote left. [SPEAKER_D]: That's crazy. Why are you so fast to vote left? [SPEAKER_C]: That's. [SPEAKER_E]: You were like. [SPEAKER_D]: You were like. Okay, so before we show rolls, if we want to vote left, I will. [SPEAKER_C]: Vote left because I'm bored with this roll. I have no intrigue. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, man. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, I got no to stir, so let's. [SPEAKER_D]: So no one has anything that they could say against Lara? [SPEAKER_C]: I mean, you keep being probably a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: You did it when. You did it when we were. [SPEAKER_F]: I was going back on Path Games. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. You don't have a villager. [SPEAKER_D]: I go on Path games. That's what I do. [SPEAKER_F]: No, because I was so bummed that I was a villager because when James fucked up, I was gonna be a seer. And I was like, oh, stoked. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay. Okay. [SPEAKER_E]: So who was the other person you switched Laura with? [SPEAKER_C]: I think Paul's a dirty liar. [SPEAKER_F]: I have a feeling you're a werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Although if I am making dirty liar. [SPEAKER_D]: I am, but I'm not. [SPEAKER_C]: He would. He would have been like, why are you so quick to vote? Left wants to throw shade on me. [SPEAKER_E]: Mike is just pointing a bit away. Just one. I want. I want to. [SPEAKER_C]: You want to catch. [SPEAKER_E]: I want to hear your birds. [SPEAKER_D]: I want to get them burps. [SPEAKER_C]: I'll get. [SPEAKER_D]: I'll get this right here. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, no, that's too low. Oh, yeah, just right there. [SPEAKER_C]: Right there. Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: I don't know if I should give the information. Hang on two minutes. [SPEAKER_E]: I mean, we have a boring thing. I confirmed James. Mitch confirms me. Okay. [SPEAKER_D]: I was thinking about lying about it just to see what she says, but I'm gonna just say straight up who I switched. I switched you and I switched Justin. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay. And that's 100% legit skis. [SPEAKER_C]: Alright. [SPEAKER_E]: Mitch did not confirm my story. He's a Tanner, I'm a werewolf. She's a werewolf. And if you trap me, that's okay. [SPEAKER_D]: What? Wait, you're a werewolf? [SPEAKER_E]: So midges came from. [SPEAKER_A]: I didn't actually take from his. I didn't actually take from his. I took from hers. [SPEAKER_E]: I took from. [SPEAKER_A]: I took from yours. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, I was so upset. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, that makes me believe you that he's Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: So if you did switch me with. [SPEAKER_D]: Laura, Laura's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: If you didn't switch me, I am a werewolf and I should die. [SPEAKER_D]: I did switch you and Laura. I was being legit. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, and I'm also being legit. I was a werewolf. So now I'm a werewolf. Yes. I'm sorry. It happens. James, I can't confirm if you were the insomniac. [SPEAKER_C]: That's okay. I spent all night knowing with confirming. [SPEAKER_E]: My store, which is. [SPEAKER_A]: I did not actually rob from him. I robbed from you. [SPEAKER_D]: I know. So if you're the Tanner, why was that your strategy? [SPEAKER_E]: No, he's telling you because he wants you to try to win as the Tanner. That's what he wants right now. No, he's. He's just sitting here on the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, I didn't even, like, pick that up. You. [SPEAKER_A]: No, I was the robber. I was the robber. So you are not. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I'm not the Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: He's trying to make you think you are. Deep down in his soul. [SPEAKER_D]: There's no situation where I'm the Tanner. I'm the troublemaker. I'm the only person who could make someone else. [SPEAKER_A]: Can Justin be the Tanner? Is that a possibility? [SPEAKER_C]: I don't care. [SPEAKER_F]: No, because. [SPEAKER_C]: Wait. No. [SPEAKER_E]: I want everyone to vote for Laura. I want everyone to vote for Laura. [SPEAKER_D]: That means you're being. And you're just three different people you said you robbed from. You're the tenor. [SPEAKER_E]: I think we kill. I think we kill Laura. [SPEAKER_D]: Any reasons why we shouldn't? [SPEAKER_F]: Well, I was a villager to start with, but if someone traded me. You switched eyes. [SPEAKER_D]: Mm. No, he's saying that he was a werewolf to start. I believe Justin. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I do too. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, here's the thing. Regardless of what Mitchell is, we gotta vote. If we vote for Laura, I win."}

[SPEAKER_B]: Where is it? [SPEAKER_C]: Just. [SPEAKER_D]: Oops. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, my God. [SPEAKER_D]: Holy. [SPEAKER_A]: Close your eyes, troublemaker. [SPEAKER_D]: Wake up. [SPEAKER_A]: You may exchange cards between two other players. Close your eyes, Insomniac. Wake up and look at your card. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, how boring. Insomniac wakes up.

I will lay it on the table. [SPEAKER_D]: I was the tanner. Wait. Oh, fuck. I said it. I said it. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't know what this means. I hate this. [SPEAKER_E]: Just throw a wrench in things. [SPEAKER_C]: This is the wrench. I hate when people just wrench it. Come on. I got nothing. [SPEAKER_E]: Who are you? [SPEAKER_B]: This guy. [SPEAKER_E]: We got two tanners. [SPEAKER_D]: Two Tanners? Where did that come out of? [SPEAKER_C]: That's what I'm trying to figure out. [SPEAKER_F]: That's what he's trying to figure out. [SPEAKER_E]: Oh, God. [SPEAKER_D]: Laura, what are you. But don't say villager. [SPEAKER_B]: Say Tanner. [SPEAKER_F]: Wait, I want to ask what the cedar saw first. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I saw two from the middle. [SPEAKER_D]: Nice. [SPEAKER_F]: No, you didn't confirm what they are, and then I'll. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't think Mitch thought two from the middle. [SPEAKER_D]: I think Mitch saw me and he knows I'm in a hole. [SPEAKER_B]: I think Mitch and Justin are werewolves. [SPEAKER_E]: I think any second now, you guys are gonna turn against me for no reason. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm already, like, partially turned, to be honest. Just because the way you said, I'm turned up. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm turned up. [SPEAKER_E]: Nice. [SPEAKER_B]: It's turned. [SPEAKER_F]: Which two parts did you see Mitch? [SPEAKER_E]: I'm not gonna say. [SPEAKER_B]: Well, point of the two. [SPEAKER_D]: You. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: I want to know who you are. I want to make sure you're on. [SPEAKER_C]: My team, because right now, I don't know what the fuck is happening here. And I believe you're the seer, but I'm like, I don't know if I believe you. [SPEAKER_F]: No, because I want to know what Mitch thought before I say what I am so I can know if he's lying. [SPEAKER_E]: But it's also vice versa as well. [SPEAKER_F]: Because one of these guys is lying. [SPEAKER_D]: Nope. We're both Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: I'll say one thing. I saw one werewolf in the middle. So we know there's not just werewolves. [SPEAKER_B]: There could be no werewolves. [SPEAKER_C]: It's possible. [SPEAKER_E]: I did not see two werewolves in the middle, otherwise I would have said. [SPEAKER_B]: What'D you see otherwise? What else was there? [SPEAKER_E]: I'll leave that for. [SPEAKER_C]: Was there a Tanner at least? [SPEAKER_B]: Did you see a Tanner? [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, so he did not see a Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: You were the troublemaker. This is exciting. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah, that's why I was like. [SPEAKER_D]: Can I ask if you switched me because. [SPEAKER_C]: Didn't switch me because I woke up his name. [SPEAKER_E]: But how would you. [SPEAKER_F]: Fucking impossible. Because I switched you two. [SPEAKER_D]: Nice. [SPEAKER_F]: So you're not an insomniac? [SPEAKER_D]: I'm an insomniac. He woke up as a Tanner. James is the werewolf. Case closed. [SPEAKER_F]: But you didn't say you woke up as the insomniac. I don't know. [SPEAKER_D]: But he looked and he saw Tanner, so he's trying to get himself killed. James, the other werewolf. So we gotta go for James, because I was the Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: I believe it. [SPEAKER_F]: Wait, no. [SPEAKER_D]: These two are gonna start backpedaling because we have them in a corner. [SPEAKER_E]: Here we go. 3. [SPEAKER_D]: So you switched us. [SPEAKER_F]: You were the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. And you know that because you woke up as the Tanner. [SPEAKER_F]: But he wouldn't know that. [SPEAKER_D]: He would. Because if he was the insomniac, he gets to look. [SPEAKER_E]: But, Laura, why were you so curious of what I saw? Because you didn't get to see any cards during the night. So you wouldn't be able to verify my story. [SPEAKER_A]: Or not. [SPEAKER_F]: I wanted to know if. Oh, fudge. I forget where I was at. Wait. I wanted to know because if you lied and said troublemaker, because then otherwise I would have been like. That makes sense. [SPEAKER_D]: That one you would know. So James is a confident werewolf right now. He's the wolf of Wall Street. The werewolf of Wall Street. [SPEAKER_C]: I thought he was the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: You're the Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: So I'm the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: You're the Tanner. So we killed James. [SPEAKER_B]: If you guys kill me, you're gonna make a mistake. Cause I am just a lowly nobody. [SPEAKER_F]: Why would you say you're a Tanner? [SPEAKER_B]: Cause I just want to get Justin killed as the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: I appreciate it, James. [SPEAKER_E]: I saw this one in the middle. [SPEAKER_F]: Oh, there we go. [SPEAKER_B]: So Mitch is fucking lying his ass off right now. Mitch is a dirty werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, you guys are confused about something. It's okay. To be honest. [SPEAKER_E]: No, I actually did not see a village in the morning or in the morning? At night. I saw a robber. I was just trying to see what. How James would react from that. [SPEAKER_A]: One minute remaining. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, so we just for sure don't kill Paul. We can't kill Paul here. [SPEAKER_B]: Let's kill Mitch. [SPEAKER_E]: So it's either James or me. [SPEAKER_B]: Let's kill Mitch. [SPEAKER_D]: I don't think it's Mitchell. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh. [SPEAKER_F]: But you said you woke up as the insomniac. [SPEAKER_D]: He's lying. [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. Oh. [SPEAKER_F]: Cause he's. [SPEAKER_D]: Because you switched. Yeah, he's the Tanner. He's trying to get himself killed. [SPEAKER_B]: Excuse me, James. [SPEAKER_C]: I don't know if this helps me. [SPEAKER_B]: What? [SPEAKER_C]: But why would I say I woke up as the insomniac if I was the 10? [SPEAKER_B]: So we could. [SPEAKER_C]: Never mind. [SPEAKER_B]: What were you gonna ask me, Mitch? [SPEAKER_C]: You're right to create suspicion. [SPEAKER_E]: What was your original story? [SPEAKER_B]: What? [SPEAKER_E]: Why? Why? If you were a villager, why would you do that? [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. We have 15 seconds. I'm pointing at James. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm pointing at James. [SPEAKER_C]: Kate, just so you know, there is. [SPEAKER_B]: Not. [SPEAKER_C]: Like, 100% James is not a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: I think he is. I think you're the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: No. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, I think he's the Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: No. James is. [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_A]: Tommy."}

Close your eyes. Everyone. Keep your eyes closed and reach out and move your car around slightly. [SPEAKER_D]: There we go. [SPEAKER_B]: Everyone wake up. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, I'm gonna put a lot of information on the table because I'm the troublemaker. I'm pretty confident that I'm not a werewolf because only a robber could take from me, and a robber's not a werewolf. So I know I'm not a werewolf. So I'm gonna give you a lot of information right away. I'm a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: I love that logic. [SPEAKER_E]: By the way, I did the same thing that I did last time. I switched you, too. [SPEAKER_A]: I'm an insomniac, so at the very least, I could verify whether he did or did not switch me. [SPEAKER_D]: Who said it was my turn? [SPEAKER_C]: I'm. I just. I'm worried that she might have been a werewolf because, you know. [SPEAKER_E]: Helpful. [SPEAKER_A]: Which one are you gonna pick? [SPEAKER_C]: I'm gonna pick all of them. [SPEAKER_A]: Nice. [SPEAKER_E]: Nice and safe. [SPEAKER_C]: No. It happened again. I was the Tanner. Wait, if you were Tanner, you're the Tanner now. So you want to die, but we're not gonna follow that. [SPEAKER_A]: That bullshit. Were you a werewolf? Yeah. The Canadian money is called a loonie. And we also have a toonie. [SPEAKER_E]: Not like all Canadian money. [SPEAKER_C]: Yep. [SPEAKER_E]: Like a loonie. [SPEAKER_C]: You got your paper. Loonies. My 50 loony denouement. James, can we hear what you are? [SPEAKER_A]: It costs 50. [SPEAKER_E]: Like it's a game, and it's just like a number. [SPEAKER_C]: Are you the hunter? Is that why you're so confident right now? [SPEAKER_D]: It's cause I'm a villager. [SPEAKER_A]: A villager. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, no. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. We need to hear from you two. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, I can confirm Mitch's story, because if you woke up, he woke up as that. [SPEAKER_E]: Here's the thing. If you were a werewolf, you're now The Tanner. So tell me. The werewolf is in your favor both ways. [SPEAKER_C]: No, because then they'll. [SPEAKER_D]: You're the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: No. Yeah, no, I. I got switched. [SPEAKER_A]: No, you started as the werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Paul and Justin are werewolf. [SPEAKER_A]: You started as the werewolf. You're the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I'm. [SPEAKER_E]: What did you rob? [SPEAKER_A]: I wasn't the robber. I was the insomniac. [SPEAKER_D]: And what'd you wake up as? [SPEAKER_A]: The insomniac. [SPEAKER_C]: You fuck. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, Paul switched us. You motherfucker. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay, that would also make sense. So it's either Paul's lying or you're both lying. [SPEAKER_D]: Paul's lying. They're fucking. Wait, how would Paul. Paul will be lying. Paul is lying about switching YouTube. Yeah, but I stole his insomnia. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, we got a donation to the donation. [SPEAKER_D]: So if he woke up in insomniac. [SPEAKER_C]: Oh, he would have switched you after the fact. [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That is what happened. [SPEAKER_D]: So. [SPEAKER_E]: But now we don't fucking know anything about them because you outed my life. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm a fucking Tanner. Like, and now you guys can't vote for me. [SPEAKER_A]: Have we heard what she is. [SPEAKER_E]: No. [SPEAKER_A]: That's all day. [SPEAKER_E]: Thanks for picking up on that. [SPEAKER_A]: Okay, let's vote. [SPEAKER_E]: Lauren, I kind of think. I think Beth. Yeah. Best option is to vote. Laura, where are you? [SPEAKER_C]: Fuck. I'll give you that donation. Thanks. Outside of this little bit, if that's okay. Just so we don't waste time of the game. Not that you're donating. I'm gonna just pause it. I'm just pausing because I can't backpack. [SPEAKER_A]: No talking. We're paused. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. What up, yo? Thank you so much for your donation. It helps us get to our goal that much quicker and it means the world to us. We'll get you that mug. We'll sign it. Well, not the mug. We'll sign the box. But just. Thank you so much. It just means the world to us. So now we'll go back to the game. What up, yo? What up, yo? Thank you so much. Who. Who? Can you do me a favor if we kill you? [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, a couple things. First of all, I can't believe somebody bought a mug after that mug plug. So, like, mega things. And number two, James, I don't think is a closet homo. Not that it would be bad if he was. Do you have a problem? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, there's no problem with. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, no, but who is he? Who's Sparky Yank? Who is. [SPEAKER_A]: Hey, let's keep going. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, we'll just. We'll let our mods deal with that as well. [SPEAKER_E]: It's pretty easy to say cool things on the Internet. So I think. Yeah, best bet is to vote her. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_C]: Who would you vote for? [SPEAKER_D]: Laura? [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah. Who if you were the. Okay. It's like cuz as the hunter, you kill who you vote for, right? [SPEAKER_D]: Vote for Paul. [SPEAKER_E]: Who vote for me. [SPEAKER_D]: I can probably vote. Don't vote for Jess. Paul's story because he punched me in the leg. [SPEAKER_A]: So the three of us sort of confirmed our stories. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, you. I, I, I didn't see you guys, but I know that I think either. [SPEAKER_A]: She'S a hunter or a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: She's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_E]: I think she's a werewolf. You guys want to let me ask. [SPEAKER_D]: Oh, but no. Then if she doesn't die, she doesn't kill. [SPEAKER_C]: Well, I want you guys to kill me. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, I know. I'll throw out a pity vote for the Tanner. [SPEAKER_E]: Why? You're not. You're on the villager team. [SPEAKER_C]: Can you help us win empathy? [SPEAKER_E]: This is. I don't want to play with James. [SPEAKER_D]: I'm voting Laura. I. I am voting Laura. Okay. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm voting Laura. [SPEAKER_C]: God damn it. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm gonna get. Who are you gonna vote for? [SPEAKER_C]: Who are you gonna vote for? [SPEAKER_A]: My gut feeling is she actually is the hunter. [SPEAKER_C]: I gotta find out who she's gonna vote for. Yeah. [SPEAKER_D]: Kill him. [SPEAKER_A]: And I think she's in a position where she doesn't know who to vote for because there is no werewolf. That's my gut. [SPEAKER_D]: Kill Justin anyways. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, sure. Just kill me. [SPEAKER_A]: He'll win if he's the tank. [SPEAKER_C]: Let's all vote for Mitchell. [SPEAKER_E]: 3."}

[SPEAKER_F]: I know for sure you're not a seer. [SPEAKER_D]: Really? [SPEAKER_F]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_B]: I challenge you to choose the one that you are. [SPEAKER_E]: Why don't you choose? [SPEAKER_C]: I'll choose Paul's. I'm just what Paul's is. [SPEAKER_B]: Oh, sure. [SPEAKER_C]: And usually you think mine is. Why? [SPEAKER_B]: Fascinating. [SPEAKER_E]: Weird. [SPEAKER_C]: I can call with the robber. [SPEAKER_B]: And. [SPEAKER_A]: Then you would have switched with somebody. [SPEAKER_C]: Yep. Who do you think I am? [SPEAKER_E]: You. [SPEAKER_D]: You. [SPEAKER_B]: You're the robber. [SPEAKER_C]: Nope. You're the robber. [SPEAKER_B]: That's why you're saying that. [SPEAKER_C]: Nope. [SPEAKER_B]: You think I'm the robber because you think I switch with somebody, and I don't want to say who I am. [SPEAKER_C]: I just said it's the funniest thing. OC Bread said Justin is the Tanner in real life. Don't do it. [SPEAKER_E]: Don't do it because I switched the two of you. [SPEAKER_B]: Are you serious? No, you didn't. [SPEAKER_E]: Yeah, I did. [SPEAKER_C]: He didn't. He's lying. [SPEAKER_D]: Because I was the seer. [SPEAKER_F]: You're not the seer. I'm the seer. [SPEAKER_C]: You're the robber. [SPEAKER_F]: You took the Tanner, but you're not the seer. [SPEAKER_D]: I was the seer. [SPEAKER_E]: Insomniac. [SPEAKER_C]: I know you didn't switch me. [SPEAKER_B]: I wasn't. I promised. [SPEAKER_E]: Okay, I didn't switch you. [SPEAKER_C]: Yeah, I was insomniac and I woke up as the insomniac. [SPEAKER_E]: I did not switch him. [SPEAKER_B]: I believe I. I can confirm I wasn't the insomniac. [SPEAKER_E]: I actually switched YouTube. [SPEAKER_B]: I wanted to see if it could catch you in a lie. [SPEAKER_C]: Why would I lie on the insomniac? [SPEAKER_D]: What? Oh, no. [SPEAKER_C]: High flying you while responding to Paul while looking in your eyes. [SPEAKER_D]: I made you the werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: Yeah, James. [SPEAKER_E]: I swapped you with Paul. Okay, well, now what? Now what? [SPEAKER_D]: Now what? [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, so I robbed after. No, we've got nowhere, guys. [SPEAKER_E]: We're making no progress. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, well, I was the robber, but I robbed after you switched us. Or before you switched us. [SPEAKER_C]: So what did you rob from? [SPEAKER_B]: I robbed from Mitchell. [SPEAKER_C]: Nice. [SPEAKER_E]: And you saw the troublemaker, and I. [SPEAKER_B]: Thought you were a troublemaker. [SPEAKER_C]: Paul's a werewolf. [SPEAKER_B]: I think I might be. [SPEAKER_E]: Now, what were you? [SPEAKER_D]: Tanner. Oh, my God. This is very. [SPEAKER_E]: And so I swapped you with Paul and then Paul. So now you're not the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: No, I'm apparently a robbery. [SPEAKER_E]: So now you want to come clean with any lies you had. [SPEAKER_B]: Justin called me. [SPEAKER_D]: I was honest. I tried to lie. So here I am, back to square one. But you. [SPEAKER_B]: What was the other thing you saw? [SPEAKER_A]: One minute remaining. [SPEAKER_D]: Let's vote left. [SPEAKER_E]: I think Paul is. [SPEAKER_B]: Laura's the werewolf. I'm the hunter. 100%. [SPEAKER_C]: Paul's a tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: No, no, no, no. [SPEAKER_E]: That's what I was suspicious of, too. [SPEAKER_B]: I definitely didn't start as the Tanner. [SPEAKER_D]: No. [SPEAKER_F]: Because James is a Tanner. So you're the Tanner now. [SPEAKER_B]: Okay, that's very possible, but, like, I don't care about that. The Tanner's too hard to win. [SPEAKER_C]: No, Paul, I would rather the villagers. [SPEAKER_B]: Won as the Tanner. I started. [SPEAKER_F]: Mitch is the Tanner now, right? [SPEAKER_B]: I started as the hunter. No, because I wasn't the robber. I was the hunter. You didn't do a hunter in the middle. [SPEAKER_F]: No, but I did. [SPEAKER_B]: No, you didn't. No, she for sure. All I know list Tanner with. Well, okay, I probably am the Tanner, but if. If I wanted to win as the Tanner, I'd be trying to get you to vote for me. Laura is lying about seeing the hunter in the middle for sure. But I couldn't be switched with the middle. [SPEAKER_C]: I think we killed James because I think we just have to accept it. [SPEAKER_B]: No, listen, regardless. [SPEAKER_C]: No, we're talking three."}

Just make sure we're on the same page. Oh, yeah. You didn't see anyone else. You didn't. John, Cena. James, stop touching my body. It's so good. No specific area, just plotting. I don't want you guys to know what he's doing. Oh, that's. I don't want anybody. Exchange your card with another player's card and then view your new card. Robert, close your eyes. Troublemaker. Wake up. Paul, stop it. Exchange car. You wish other players. You wish I would stop. Troublemaker. Close your eyes. Insomniac. Sorry, There's a little dot under the table. Hold your card. I can't find it anymore. Insomniac. Close your eyes. Everyone keep your eyes closed and reach out and move. We have played with the doppelganger. He just makes the. That roll just makes the night thing take forever. I was gonna ask, did you see the Being Frank? Always Sunny. That's the name of the episode. Yeah, the newest one. Oh, no. I've been missing some of the newest ones. It's so funny. Oh, I'm so excited to watch the newest one. It's so good. Okay, who's. What? I want you to go first this time. Tanner. You is being truthful. And now we're gonna vote for you. Let's go to vote. Alright, let's go around the table. Mitch, what are you. No, I want to first hear Paul's initial lie. Okay. No, I'm gonna switch up my strategy because I'm a good guy, so I'm not gonna lie as a good guy this time. But I'm gonna withhold some initial information. I was the insomniac and I will be able to confirm because I did not wake up as the insomniac. So I will be able to confirm someone else's story based on that. That sounds like an insomniac's lie, Laura. So if you know that you switched me with somebody or that you robbed me, so one of them is the troublemaker. Then don't. Or the robber. Yeah, somebody's the troublemaker. Or the robber. So if you are that, maybe don't so ask me. You're the hunter. Who would you take with you? Take. Use your information as this roll. You're gonna kill me. Yeah. This story is just all over the place. It's in one place. I don't Even have, like. I literally just. I was in South Megan and I didn't like it. I'm just kidding. I have no idea. Werewolf. Didn't you? Nope. Yeah, that's why. Who did you get switched in? That's the question. Well, if I got switched, I wouldn't know. I just woke up as something. Paul, somebody. Here's the thing. Someone will be able to confirm my story of what I woke up as and know that it wasn't a werewolf. All right, well, I'll get the ball. Rol. I can confirm Paul's story. Yeah. I am one of these two. And now I'm suspicious of you. Honest. Here you go. So she has trouble making werewolf. I have robber and seer. Okay. How do we make progress? You say you prove that you're the troublemaker and not werewolf. Who did you switch? This is how you prove it. So, yeah, this is very true. Think about your lie carefully. Do I. Take your time. Not too much, right? No time. 3, 2, 1. Switched us to fuck this safe. It was pretty good. Yeah. Well, then I'm the downer. Let's go. Mitch, I think you're the werewolf. I can agree with that. I disagree. I don't trust Paul. I also don't trust robber. Seer. He's not an actual robber. Seer. He's a seer robber. They go in that order. Justin, if you were to see her, I'm just gonna fucking assume. No, you were the robber. You fuck. You were the robber. Who'd you obviously stole from Paul. Yeah. He is the insomniac. He woke up as the robber. Did you wake up as a robber? Yep. Yeah. Yeah. These two are fucking werewolves. I am the robber. Justin is the insomniac. Or we're both werewolves. I think. I think Laura is the werewolf. I'm also on that page as well. Here's the thing. Yeah. Because if we were both werewolves, we'd have no idea what's here. Yeah. So for us to both claim these roles, assuming. Let's be real careful here. This seems like a. Like. Yeah, that's. That's why this is what I'm just saying. This is what I'm. I just want to. Just want to rule it out. I'm not. Let me rule it out for you. If we were both werewolves, we wouldn't know what was in the center. So for both of us to confirm that were the insomniac and rob no one to catch us in a lie about that. That's crazy. He said insomniac before anyone else Said anything. Yeah, that's. But at the same time. Yeah. I don't know. At the same time. If Laura switched us and they're both werewolves, these two could be in the middle and we could be like. That could be the setup. That would be so risky. It would be risky, but fuck, there's only 40 seconds left. I like the idea that he said he was insomniac. Right. I don't trust two. I think it's either Laura or nobody. I think it might actually be the tag. I think he is. I don't trust. I think Laura's the werewolf. I'm gonna be taking out Laura. Unless I'm not the hunter anymore because she truly is the troublemaker. I'm taking out Laura. I'm taking out Laura. So let's take her out. So if you switch me and Mitchell, I'm still gonna kill you. If I get voted out or something, tell me. That's your foot, James. Right. Okay, good. What? No. Are you actually the troublemaker, Laura? Yes. You switched James there. So you can't take anybody out because. Yeah. All right. We kill Mitchell. He points at Laura. No, we kill Laura. Oh, yeah. Kill me. No. Let's do that. Laura, what are you. Laura. Oh, and I was going to take the tanner, you jerk. What? I was gonna take the tanner. I thought you might be a werewolf with her. And that's why you're playing. We all believed you as the tan. No, no, no, no, no, no. I said I thought you might be the werewolf. Oh, interesting. I didn't mean to throw that at you. So never smoothly. Never listen to the man attempting to throw doubt listening to my reasons. There was a little bit where you were getting Mitchell of that. We could have been werewolves. It was good."}

After I was the seer, I saw two in the middle. They were both bad. One was a werewolf. One was a tanner. So there's still a werewolf out there. I mean, it could be that, but it probably is out there, but at least which is two. Which. All right, why don't we go around now? We go counterclockwise. We'll all give the information we know it could. Why? Just in case someone else. Okay. No, there's no drunk. Okay. Okay. I was actually the troublemaker for the first time this time. I switched Mitchell. But I don't want to say who the other one is yet. I want to give almost all my information away. Cool. I switched Mitchell. He's not see her anymore. Eric. Well, I was the robber. Nice. And I definitely also switched people. You stole from somebody? Yeah, I stole from somebody. I was the werewolf. I saw the insomniac in the center. Okay. Okay, so now this matters. Which two did you look at? Which one did you look at? I looked at this one. Oh, yeah. I looked at this one and this one. Yeah. Nice. All checks out so far. Nice. You probably might still be the werewolf. Okay, I can confirm I'm the hunter. Okay. I didn't switch Justin. So now the question is, did Eric steal from Justin? Yeah. I did not steal from Justin. Did you steal from. Can you confirm I was the hunter? Yes. Nice. What we should have done was get him to guess what you were or tell you what you were. All checks out. Well, there's a choice. But unless we've got two werewolves at the table and no Sears. No, we don't. No. Well, if. If Mike was a werewolf and Eric robbed him, he would confirm his story as the hunter. Oh, he scarred me. Why are you people still here? Because it's only 1250. Yeah, and you look quite sharp today. Fuck you. No, I think we should kill me. I say we just go for Justin. I say we kill Justin. Switch Mitch. With who? Yeah, who'd you switch? Who'd you switch? You. Oh, no. After. Yeah. No. So now Mitch is the hunter. Eric's the serial. So Mitch is the hunter. Yeah, I'll check. We vote for Mitch. He points at Justin just for. Just for drama. Just for the drama. Mitch votes at me. I'd love it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Let's do it. Can we do it? No. Let's do that. Let's do it."}

You may look at another player's card or two of the center cards. I just love that they keep the theme. Close your eyes. Doesn't matter what song you play. Wake up.

I also have info that requires someone else to have some troublemaker. That sounds like a lot of shit happened. A lot of shit did happen. I. I feel like I have a role that's important on a passive level. So I will say I was the hunter when I went to bed. Okay. Can you. Hunter is like something. Yes or no? Can you verify a story so far? Just yes or no. That story so far? Either one of us. No, you can't verify. Did you switch me with anyone? Yeah. Okay, that's interesting. See, I was the insomniac and I'm now the robber. So you switched him with me because I was the robber. Well, he woke up as the robber. I was the robber. Oh, you switched after me though. So I had switched with Paul. Then you switched these two. Yep. Mmm. Wait, what? What? What was the order? Do that one more time. Do that one more time. So you switch me and Mike. No, no, I stole from you. You stole from me. Then you swapped. No. Yeah, he swapped. I swapped you too. And Paul was the werewolf. So you're the. So you're the werewolf? Yeah. Okay, Paul, can you confirm this? I don't fucking know. What the fuck? Yeah, pause. So he'll break it down. Whatever you were, he stole from you. Whatever the fuck you were. Okay. And then I swapped you and Eric. And I was the hunter. And I'm still the hunter. Cuz I'm looking for my kill. So whatever you were is now sitting on Mike. Okay, don't vote for Mike. He was the werewolf. He was the Tanner. I'm the Tanner. I was a Tanner. Fuck. Okay, so I started as a Tanner. So he's a Tanner now. That's why he's saying so. Both werewolves are in the center. Yeah, that's why he put werewolf in his thing right away. So we all vote to the left. Hold on. No, no, you're the. Okay, I think you're the Tanner, I believe. I think you're still worried that you might be the werewolf. I don't know why he would be worried about that. I think that as. As well he wouldn't have a counter. So how do we do it without him fucking up the vote? By voting to the right. Well, he. It wouldn't benefit him. He'd lose. He would still lose. Yeah, yeah, but I can make the village lose. Okay, but. So no one can confirm Justin's story though. No, no, but if there is for me, then vote for me. I'll fucking kill whoever does it. Yeah, you'll point it. Could it be a werewolf? Yeah, before we just let that. Yeah, because he could have seen the hunter in the middle. Are you lying about being a troublemaker? No, I'm pretty sure. I'm pretty sure. I'm pretty sure this is legit. Yeah, no, I'm pretty sure this is legit. But Paul does mention there's a possibility Justin was a werewolf. Oh, peanut butter, babe. Because literally what's happening right now is both werewolves are in the middle. Yeah. As is the seer, who could really help. It can happen, though. Like, we can't say that that's some sort of anomaly. Right. It's very likely to happen just in case there being. I know, but that would just be really. That worked out really well for you if you are a werewolf. When did he say his role it was? Right away. Right away. But someone. A werewolf who sees under the mill would do it right away. Well, actually, as a safety effect. Then why don't we all vote for you? I have no one to kill. Vote left. No, because then I'll kill you and we'll lose. Why would we lose? Because the villagers would die. The only way for the villagers to win if there's no werewolves is if we all vote for. If everyone gets one vote. So it's a tie between everybody. Okay, now we should be worried. Yeah. No, but he's a Tanner, so he wouldn't fuck it up. A Tanner would. Well, he could. Either way. He loses either way. He could just download Tanner, make us all lose. But I'm not. He still won't win. But he'll. He could. He could prevent us. So the question is, are we? Are we? Or could Justin be a world. Yeah. I am the hunter. Mm. If you're not you're playing a very smart game. Just as the werewolf. What card did you look at? Because there wasn't one minute remaining. Well, what if I was the werewolf? I never stole from anybody from the whole time. You would have been the werewolf. Beginning. So what did you see in I didn't. Fucking luck. Because I was the office. He was the Tanner. Oh. Oh, right. Yeah. Okay. Then we're good. You're right. No, because otherwise you would give us that info. There's no reason for you not to. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Vote to the left. Yep. Yep. It's our only. It's. It's up to Mike what happens. So. Yeah. And it's a gamble in Justin. I am a hunter. I."}

[SPEAKER_D]: Because I am so the troublemaker and I so switched. [SPEAKER_E]: So you probably woke up and saw werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_E]: So the person you switched with would be a werewolf. [SPEAKER_D]: Mm. And does that person want to come forward? [SPEAKER_E]: It wasn't me. [SPEAKER_C]: Right, Right, man. Right. Right. [SPEAKER_D]: Well, you just outed yourself, didn't you? [SPEAKER_E]: No, you didn't. [SPEAKER_C]: No, you don't. [SPEAKER_D]: So you might. [SPEAKER_C]: You can confirm me. [SPEAKER_B]: No, I can't. [SPEAKER_D]: So is the person who I switched with, who thinks that he's a werewolf, gonna. Gonna be open? [SPEAKER_F]: Why do we think Justin's lying? [SPEAKER_D]: Because I switched them. So if Justin started the insomniac and, oh, he saved the insomniac. Okay, then he's lying. [SPEAKER_B]: Because anybody else? I do have information, but I'm gonna save it. [SPEAKER_D]: Why share it now? We need it now. No, dude, we need it now. [SPEAKER_F]: It's three minutes. [SPEAKER_B]: No, no, no. [SPEAKER_C]: Okay, what's four minutes? [SPEAKER_E]: I'm voting to the left. [SPEAKER_F]: You know I was werewolf. You switched us. [SPEAKER_D]: I switched to you and just admitted. [SPEAKER_B]: He was the werewolf. [SPEAKER_F]: Me and Justin. [SPEAKER_D]: I wasn't. I did not switch you and Justin. I switched Mitch and Justin. [SPEAKER_F]: No. Which means. [SPEAKER_D]: Then why is Mitch not admitting what he was? [SPEAKER_E]: Alright, no one's asked me yet. [SPEAKER_C]: Mitch, what are you? [SPEAKER_E]: I was a hunter. [SPEAKER_C]: I can confirm that story. I'm a hunter. When I woke up. [SPEAKER_E]: Fascinating. I said fascinating so many times. I guess it's my name. [SPEAKER_D]: So you were the werewolf? [SPEAKER_A]: Yeah. [SPEAKER_F]: And then now I'm not. [SPEAKER_D]: Based on what? In fact. [SPEAKER_C]: Did you look in the center? [SPEAKER_B]: I did. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, so we're all voting for you. That I know. [SPEAKER_E]: Why would you lie at the beginning? Just to throw. [SPEAKER_F]: Right? [SPEAKER_C]: We got A werewolf out. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, it's true. [SPEAKER_F]: I mean. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, and it worked. It actually it did save us. [SPEAKER_B]: So I'm guessing then this is that. Unless he's the Tanner. Because he did come out of. [SPEAKER_C]: I think it's the best boat. [SPEAKER_B]: It is the best boat. [SPEAKER_C]: But Mike, what did you saw those two? [SPEAKER_B]: I saw these two. [SPEAKER_C]: I'm willing to kill Paul just for. [SPEAKER_B]: We can confirm that there could be. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, I think it's you. [SPEAKER_C]: If this one is. Was so short, we'll play one more. [SPEAKER_F]: Is there any other possibility? [SPEAKER_E]: We don't have a tank. Oh, there's a Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: It could. [SPEAKER_D]: Yes, but that's the only risk. And it's not a big risk. [SPEAKER_B]: That's not a big risk. [SPEAKER_C]: It's a 5050 chance that he dies. [SPEAKER_E]: He's totally the Tanner. Paul doesn't just say the truth the first time. [SPEAKER_D]: If we learned about anything, he's. No, but he thought. [SPEAKER_B]: He thought he got switched with somebody. Oh, Paul. [SPEAKER_E]: No Tanner. [SPEAKER_C]: Then here's what you do. You kill me, I'll point a Paul. [SPEAKER_F]: I'm gonna lose regardless. [SPEAKER_D]: Yes. [SPEAKER_B]: No, no, no. [SPEAKER_D]: If you die. [SPEAKER_F]: If he's a Tanner, if I'm a Tanner, he'll still win. [SPEAKER_C]: But I want to use the hunter ability. [SPEAKER_D]: They want you to join. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm quite convinced he's. [SPEAKER_F]: Are you gonna show us what we missed? I'm taking my ccp. [SPEAKER_D]: I'll take the chance he's the channer. Because if we do the whole vote to the left thing, which we were gonna do, he just votes the opposite direction. We still lose. [SPEAKER_C]: But if he's the werewolf and he votes to the left, he wins. [SPEAKER_D]: Exactly. [SPEAKER_F]: So I'll say that if I'm the Tanner, I will vote with the village. I'm not that kind of Tanner. [SPEAKER_B]: Right. I didn't know we were keeping squad. [SPEAKER_D]: Okay, let's aim at the werewolf. [SPEAKER_C]: I want to know what Mitch wants to do because I want to ride with him. [SPEAKER_E]: I think he's a Tanner, and I think we should vote to the left, Dave Mitchell. [SPEAKER_B]: I think we should. More likely he's more likely chances. If we vote him out, we win. [SPEAKER_C]: I agree with that. [SPEAKER_D]: Yeah, I'm sorry. I see more two out of the three chances. No, because I see a 100% chance of us losing versus a 50% chance of us losing. [SPEAKER_F]: They got some math. [SPEAKER_E]: I'm ready to go to a vote. I'm voting to the left."}

Okay, so what's some knowledge around the table? Mine's boring. Really? Really. Okay, interesting. I can confirm Paul's. The Tanner's a liar. I looked at Paul's car. You fucking looked at me. I did. When does the Seer get to look around? First, after the werewolves. Immediate strategy. Yeah, how's the hunter? Wait. Okay, guys, straight up, I'm gonna say it. Remember, say the cards you have out loud. Troublemaker. Yeah, Justin is actually lying. Justin is lying. Because if Justin is the first person to look, I was straight up the Tanner. Seems good, doesn't it? Yeah, seems good. Checks out. What? He said he was the Tanner when he went to bed. Yeah, I can confirm that Justin is not the Seer because I was the Seer. Okay, so we know he's the Tanner. Wait. No, no, no. I don't know what's happened. Oh, what in the fuck? So you robbed the Seer? No. What? I robbed the Tanner. Oh, so you robbed him? No, I robbed Paul. Boom. What? I don't understand anything. You mean either. I don't know what to do. I know I'm the hunter. I will take you down with me. If you robbed Paul, then I was not the. You were the robbery, not the Tanner. So this way, then he's the Tanner. He said he was the Tanner, and that hasn't changed. Unless I switch up. Justin is lying, man. I don't believe any of you. Three. We have three werewolves, Mike. It's you and I versus three werewolves right now. Well, I'm sorry to say, Mitch, I switched you with somebody. Yeah, I'm deaf. I. Yeah. Why do you. Why are you coming out as the Tanner? You lose, remember? Yeah. Oh, I think you're playing that. I'm so confused. And then you're playing that hardcore. You started the Seer. Hey. Yeah. What if I say this? I switched you with Mitch. Were you still the Tanner now that he threw this, like, fake ass? No, no, I 100%. I switched you and Mitch. No, I don't think you did. I 100% bit. No, I 100% believe you. Okay? I'm the hunter. Because when the troublemaker came up and you said, don't switch my card, I switched your fucking card. Because he said it. No. Okay. Gave your story then. Because I did switch it. Who? You switched him and Mitch. Sorry. Was there wood last night? No. No. So nobody. Did you have wood? There was in the morning. I was like, what? I 100% switch your tattoo. Justin. What the fuck were you. Actually, you were. I was the Seer. You were the seer. Okay. And you were the Seer and you were the tanner. Neat checks out. I don't care about these two rules. I switched these two, okay? On the Tanner. We got two sears and a hunter. I say vote to the left. All checks out, okay? Nobody. Nobody looked at Mitchell's card, right? I might be a werewolf. And I just saw. I think Justin and Mitch fucking actually are werewolves. Look at that. It was those two. Yeah. Okay, but then you switched one. So maybe Eric and Justin are werewolves. Shaboom. No. So that would be that. I think the good vote. In which case Mitch still wants to draw attention. One minute remaining. I think the good vote is Eric. I agree. What were you. You were the werewolf. I say we believe both of these two as Sears at the same time. Well, no, Justin's the only one really defending it. I think we need to. Yeah, we need to vote for Justin. Justin's the only one I'm confident about. There's too much wishy washiness. Yeah. What did you see if you were this here, you haven't revealed. I looked at two in the center. Would you see? I saw insomniac. Seconds left. So. So who's starting? I saw him as the tanner. 20 seconds left. So we can't kill Eric. It's not the Tanner. No, he's not the Tanner anymore. I switched him out. Mitch. Mitch what were you? You were the hunter. I was a werewolf. So vote Eric. It all checks out. Except for the lie. Or the lie. Guys, we have two fucking Sears here, so everything seems to check out. Yeah, but the werewolf dies on every."}
